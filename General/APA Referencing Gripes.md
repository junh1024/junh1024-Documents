# APA Referencing Gripes

## Introduction

Stuff.

## Transliteration Issues

For some languages, like Korean, their characters have no meanings and romanization is a fairly straightforward process. romanization destroys the meaning and it's now unsearchable, which defeats a purpose/principle of referencing, unless the purpose was to actually appease white people so that they don't see any scary-looking letters, which seems to be the case. For languages like Chinese, there usually is a 1-1 mapping from Chinese to Pinyin, but it quickly turns into a meaningless mess of alphabet soup. Like "你的名字 我的姓氏" becomes "Ni Di Ming Zi Wo Di Xing Shi". It's meaningless to the marker, and meaningless to a native reader. The raw text is at least meaningful to a native reader.

For Japanese, it's even more complex. Japanese has a many-many mapping. Like, 1 character can have many readings, and 1 sound can have many readings. It's highly contextual, and romanization can be hard, especially for names. APA style says references should be transliterated. If you can't romanize the text, you can't sort it in a reference list. If you ask a computer to sort it, it might sort by Unicode code point.

Text should be translated into English, so that markers & most readers can understand how it supports your argument. 

You might ask how such as situation might arise when you can understand&/ translate the text, but a correct romanization of the title &/ the author is not available. I'll admit this is a rare case, but it could happen. APA would not've had such prolific if it didn't work in 99% of cases (in its domains). Although it's annoying.

Please don't force us to transliterate cuz:

- It's hard to get correct in some cases
- It mangles text into something which is meaningless for markers & native readers

But it's wrong and your marker will deduct marks for wrong referencing.

It's circlejerk.

You can be consistent per-string, reference, or document, as long as it's searchable & correct.

## Fragile Formatting

If there's no formatting, like italics/bold, and indents, it's somehow wrong. Maybe it got lost during editing. When copying references from multiple sources to integrate into your document, you need to preserve the formatting which is relevant to APA, but discard the rest to be consistent with your document. This is annoying.

Using software to manage this like Endnote is even more annoying due to use of 2+ softwares & windows, more possible weird issues, you need to fill in forms to make a new reference, and it's not advised to edit the reference directly in your document.

## What do I suggest?

Some sensible ordering, as long as it isn't like, iroha order.

Bullet points, numbering, or line spacing to separate references.
