* https://myanimelist.net/character/6499/Nagi This is Murakumo. She even has tied bangs & a staff. Behavior unknown. The OP "approximately" sounds like [this](https://hearthis.at/jzgmyrcb/kan-imas/) (my mashup)
* https://myanimelist.net/character/106863/Rino_Endou from jinsei looks like Ooyodo. She's shy.
* https://myanimelist.net/character/74081/Megumi_Amatsuka from GJ-bu looks like Abruzzi (she has her hair down in only 1 ep so you don't see it)
* https://myanimelist.net/character/38538/Eucliwood_Hellscythe from Zombie Desk car looks like Hibiki. Also a cool temperament.
* https://myanimelist.net/character/5504/Haruka_Minami looks like Haruna, just imagine her hair as black. Also dere.
* https://myanimelist.net/character/37212/Minko_Tsurugi/pictures This is your Akebono. A real tsun.
* https://mashiroirosymphony.fandom.com/wiki/Miu_Amaha This is your Shoukaku. Yes she has a headband but not white hair, but it's what's inside that matters - she's a real dere.
* https://myanimelist.net/character/54727/Ginbei_Haruomi_Sawatari looks like Shimushu

People have complained that I didn't include the obvious pair of Izumi Sagiri & Sagiri. Yes they both have grey hair, but that's it. Their temperament is different. Sagiri is a tsun but Izumi is not.

* https://myanimelist.net/character/62945/Yukari_Akiyama from Girls & Panzer looks like Mutsuki. Kanon/kurogane knights [did it first](https://seiga.nicovideo.jp/seiga/im6662158) so it must be true, right?
* https://myanimelist.net/character/62947/Mako_Reizei from GnP is probably a better match for Hatsuyuki. They both like sleeping. Mako is top of her class. But we'll just need to take Hatsuyuki's word that she's capable.
* https://hai-furi.fandom.com/wiki/Mei_Irizaki from High School Fleet is your i401. They're both genki & have similar hairstyles & colors.
