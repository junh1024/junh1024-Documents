Part 2

* [Nagi](https://myanimelist.net/character/6499/Nagi) from Kannagi is Murakumo. She even has tied bangs & a staff. Behavior unknown. The OP "approximately" sounds like [this](https://hearthis.at/junh1024/kan-imas/) (my mashup).
* [Megumi Amatsuka](https://myanimelist.net/character/74081/Megumi_Amatsuka) from GJ-bu looks like Abruzzi (she has her hair down in only 1 ep so you don't see it).
* [Eucliwood Hellscythe](https://myanimelist.net/character/38538/Eucliwood_Hellscythe) from Zombie Desk Car looks like Hibiki. Also a cool temperament.
* [Haruka Minami](https://myanimelist.net/character/5504/Haruka_Minami) looks like Haruna, just imagine her hair as black. Also dere.
* [Minko Tsurugi](https://myanimelist.net/character/37212/Minko_Tsurugi/pictures) This is your Akebono. A real tsun. https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7c/34/17/7c3417c6b0c38ef2a20c9a8d1217a0c0.jpg https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/113587.jpg
* [Miu Amaha](https://mashiroirosymphony.fandom.com/wiki/Miu_Amaha) This is your Shoukaku. Yes, she has a headband but not white hair, but it's what's inside that matters - she's a real dere.
* [Ginbei Haruomi Sawatari](https://myanimelist.net/character/54727/Ginbei_Haruomi_Sawatari) from OniAi looks like Shimushu.

Part 3

* [Yukari Akiyama](https://myanimelist.net/character/62945/Yukari_Akiyama) from Girls & Panzer looks like Mutsuki. Kanon/kurogane knights [did it first](https://seiga.nicovideo.jp/seiga/im6662158) so it must be true, right?
* [Mako Reizei](https://myanimelist.net/character/62947/Mako_Reizei) from GnP is probably a better match for Hatsuyuki. They both like sleeping. Mako is top of her class. But we'll just need to take Hatsuyuki's word that she's capable.
* [Mei Irizaki](https://hai-furi.fandom.com/wiki/Mei_Irizaki) from High School Fleet is your i401. They're both genki & have similar hairstyles & colors.

These might not appear in any IMAS anime, they're probably a bit obscure:
- [Meguru Hachimiya](https://project-imas.wiki/Meguru_Hachimiya) from IMAS = Prinz Eugen. Complete with a cheery personality & foreign-ness.
* [Atsumi Munakata](https://www.project-imas.wiki/Atsumi_Munakata) is Naka. Yuno, being in IMAS implicitly makes you an idol. She's very genki & the buns, but also touchy-feely.
- [Chihiro Senkawa](https://project-imas.wiki/Chihiro_Senkawa) looks like Shigure

* [Etou Kanami](https://anidb.net/character/89541) from Toji no Miko looks like Yukikaze
* [Origami Koori](https://safebooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=origami_koori) from School Girl Strikers also looks like Hatsuyuki. Apart from being kuudere & capable, there's not much info on this minor character

- [Rei Takanashi](https://alicegearaegis.fandom.com/wiki/Rei_Takanashi) from Alice Gear Aegis = Yuubari , or [Samidare](https://safebooru.donmai.us/posts/4122234) if her hair is down

- [Norie Okazaki](https://myanimelist.net/character/35470/Norie_Okazaki) from Tamayura, in certain situations, looks like Ayanami. In addition, most of the cast wears uniforms similar to the Ayanami-class. Also, a decently-rated anime franchise.

- [Kamiyama Shiki](https://vndb.org/v20424/chars#chars) Summer Pockets looks like i-168. An anime adaptation has been announced, but she might not be in it since she's only in the 2nd release.
- [Hazuki Ren](https://anidb.net/character/110055) from Love Live superstar looks like Houshou. They both have a reserved attitude and some responsibility, but whether she shows responsibility is another matter.
