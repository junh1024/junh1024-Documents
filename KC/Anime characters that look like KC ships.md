# Anime characters that look & behave like KC ships

## Introduction
This document lists Anime & Game character from other franchises that look like (and preferably have a similar temperament) KC ships. Most anime is mediocre so I wouldn't recommend watching them unless I say otherwise.

The document was started in 2021. In 2025, there were major improvements in formatting and organization. Rather than organizing into arbitrary parts, it's now organized by ship type. The different ship categories are approximate since I wanted to distribute the ships evenly across categories. This document is subject to change.

## Destroyer Escort or Small Ship

- [Mako Reizei](https://myanimelist.net/character/62947/Mako_Reizei) from GnP is Hatsuyuki. They both like sleeping. Mako is top of her class. But we'll just need to take Hatsuyuki's word that she's capable.
- [Origami Koori](https://safebooru.donmai.us/posts?tagsisorigami_koori) from School Girl Strikers also looks like Hatsuyuki. Apart from being kuudere & capable, there's not much info on this minor character
- [Nagi](https://myanimelist.net/character/6499/Nagi) from Kannagi is Murakumo. She even has tied bangs & a staff. Behavior unknown. The OP "approximately" sounds like [this](https://hearthis.at/junh1024/kan-imas/) (my mashup)

- [Norie Okazaki](https://myanimelist.net/character/35470/Norie_Okazaki) from Tamayura, in certain situations, looks like Ayanami. In addition, most of the cast wears uniforms similar to the Ayanami-class. Also, a decently-rated anime franchise.
