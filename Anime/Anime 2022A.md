# Anime Commentary 2022A

## Introduction

Plot summaries are about 90% accurate. You can use them as long as you abide by the Creative Commons attribution non-commercial rules. I used to do remarks only but I realised my remarks don't make any sense without the context of the anime, so I switched to also doing plot summaries in later documents. I then switched to a  new style in later documents. Plot summary is indicated by text paragraph.

- my remarks are indicated like this. 
 

## Isekai Harem

### Episode 1
As mentioned elsewhere also, the MC's design takes heavy hints from Kirito of Sword Art Online. He starts off in a barn, which feels kinda like Konosuba where the main gang sleeps in a barn. His Sword has a large red jewel, reminiscent of the staff from Lyrical Nanoha. The music is right on point when he has his various monologues. And it is suspiciously convenient that the villager has prepared a lot of things for him. 
Bonus points, hard to find age, The top-down aerial shot of the cart turning a corner at 13'28" is nice.

### Episode 2
This ep starts with a flash-forward, and it shows what seems to be Michio's son. I find it surprising that he has a lot of dosh for what he sold a few days ago, such that only a minority is to be earned for buying Roxanne. or maybe it shouldn't be. Alan is giving a lot of advice, he wants Michio to succeed so he can shill Roxanne to him. It's also suspiciously convenient that a labyrinth was discovered near the town "just a few days ago". He finds a secret room in the labyrinth, which is full of a ridiculous amount of tree monsters. Luckily, he gets out alive, thanks to the Durandal, no, plot armor. At the end, we see something about bandits having revenge. Overall, after completing the episode, an unsatisfying feeling.

### Episode 3
What is potentially inconsistent is that Michi wasn't able to warp out of a battle in the labyrinth, but he can warp around the bandit house while the bandits are hostile

## Oreimo S2

### Episode 9

Resume 13/08/2022. review ep9, Ruri is really messing with Kyousuke by dating him, then breaking up & moving away. He's desperate to see her again, and runs into her again. But then she faints. I guess she can barely control her "empire of emotions" which she's built (the relationships she has with everyone). More Ruri messing with him, and then tea at his house where things go back to "normal".

### Episode 10
EP begins with meruru OP, unexpected. We get to see Bridget & Kanako again, which is nice. We get to see the context of Kirino's wedding dress and why it's torn. It's not that Kyousuke is doing a fake wedding with her. It would be implausible that a bike would be faster than taxi given (I assume) a large distance across a city.

### Episode 11
So kyousuke has to live by himself due to studies & suddenly becoming too close to his sis. Sis buys a small fridge which is enough for 2-3 people. I think a bar fridge would be more suitable for 1 person. There's talk of a housewarming party, but we don't see it in this ep. As a 2nd welcoming gift, Kirino gives something predictable... another VN. "This isn't an Eroge" ... "She's eating a sausage". Apart from the looks, Kanako's deductive reasoning is smart about his sister. Kanako's Bento is bitter which suggests it's burnt. Perhaps the burnt flavor has been infused throughout the dish. Ayase is violent, bringing along a kitchen knife (but still sheaved) as a welcoming gift. She even pokes him with it. I guess this is where the yandere tendencies about her originate. However, Ruri prefers to use words to offend. This is why I dub thee, Violent Angel (Ayase) & Gentle Demon (Ruri). Kuroneko now has a Kuro school uniform. A black uniform makes Ruri's black hair blend in. might as well be a Matoi Ryuuko. It was nice of them to have a chuunibyou fantasy fight scene. "I have placed a curse and this man is under my possession forever" is just a fancy way of saying he still likes me and I still like him. 

### Episode 12
Long time to see Sayori, and with beautiful long hair. Buy Sayori this time instead of the peacemaker is just more trouble on the heap. Which leaves Kirino to decide to choose her best friend Ayase to do cooking duties so that Kyousuke doesn't have to eat microwave food. I would've thought that taking turns would be fair, but we later see it's not just cooking, it's housework too. So 1 person would be less distracting than a panel of girls wanting feedback & competition. We get to see Ayase's sweet side. Ayase is also thankful that Kirino chose her for this. She claims she wants to do this as a way of thanking Kirino, but actually she also wants to spend time with Kyousuke. That few seconds of a photographer I thought was the paparazzi & we might get to see pics later but on MAL forums it's just what remains of a stalker for the anime adaptation.

Saori Unleashed.

### Episode 13
Oreimo s2 ,13.
Quite a boring episode, with flashbacks to the past. It doesn't add much drama to the current situation. We see why Kirino is an Otaku. She was aiming to excel at academics and sports like her brother but when she finally did, her brother was no longer excelling and doesn't care that her sis did, and offered no praise. Then she turned to VNs and got all the excitement and praise she craved. But it still doesn't completely make sense to me. Also, didn't Kirino only dye her hair only from teenager onwards?

### Episode 14
It takes a special kind of dick to reject both Ayase and Kuroneko, and Kanako too in the next episode. But to his credit, he knows that. Kuroneko isn't taking it too well, and she's allowed to throw a tantrum after all the happy memories that they have been through, flashing past on the screen. She was prolly expecting to be accepted. She "lifts" the curse by tearing her "master plan" diary into many pieces, only to place another one, cursing the whole world. Note that this diary IIRC also had the sketch of her being friends with Kirino & Kousaka just shown a few eps ago. It's ironic that the eldest sister of the Gokou family has the most drama since they have a love life (also like in Tamako Market & A Silent Voice). And that the younger sister(s) are more grounded. On reddit they say Kyousuke has rejected all of the girls so that he has a "clean" slate to propose to Kirino. Kyousuke's confession was supposedly pre-arranged to some extent. An absolutely absurd confession. Nice to see Ruri & Kyousuke can still get along. Recall Ruri indicated in ep11 that she would still love Kyousuke even if he loved his sister more. IDK if that's still true.

### Episode 15
Kirino says she "has to" play this Christmas-edition game right now since it was designed for this, but she's having trouble playing with a clear head due to Kyousuke's confession. She pauses the game. I do this a lot on games & episodes. Why would Kanako ask Kyousuke out at a performance no less? You would think that it should be a more private situation. Maybe Kanako was half-expecting to be rejected. And she takes it in her stride to make him regret it. AN acceptance might make the crowd jealous. 

### Episode 16
"Now that everyone's here", but where's Ruri? I won't tell anyone (about your relationship with Kirino), despite that they're in the club room with other people. I thought that the person waiting for Kirino & Kyousuke on the way back from school would be Ruri, but it's Manami. Right, Manami wanted to have a proper fight with Kirino. And she does. This would be the Manami rejection I guess. I thought that Manami's glasses might get broken during their fight. It did. A bit miraculous she didn't get any eye injuries from that. Costs about $200 USD to get your feelings & words out? Is she able to walk home w/o glasses? They go to a church to have a fake wedding in full dress, but with no-one else present. Must be expensive to hire a church for a short while just for this. Is it the same church that Kirino did her photoshoot in? She returns the engagement ring. As they've finished their graduation, they return to being "normal" siblings.

## Oreimo S2 specials
I thought that these two specials would be a bit bad since they are fake VN gameplay but they turned out OK with a scenario of Sakurai Akimi trying to date Kyousuke and Kirino trying to test chocolate on Akimi. There is a very large box in your room. I recognise this scenario. It is your lover trying to surprise you by being in the box. if this were to happen in real life you would need ventilation holes on the box. Sakura is a great "writer" but these are fairly common tropes in Japan. I thought it was a reasonable idea to cut Sakurai from the anime since the Kyousuke harem is already large enough.
the previous special was bad and basically useless since it's mostly an advertisement for the next special.

Working 10

If Kozue drinks that much beer, wouldn't she be passed out?

### Episode 10
Resume watching 12/08/### Episode 2022
review of the ending of ep9, The "real" manager of Wagnaria has finally reunited with his wife, Haruna. Wow, things are really happening in S### Episode 3
We finally get to see Takanashi's mom. There is a live broadcast on TV, with an interview of her mom. Isn't it a bad idea to have a stand-in so you can come home? We finally see Izumi doing something productive. Kozue looks nice as a teenager & not drunk. 

### Episode 11

When Todoroki clocks out, I thought she would be off-site, but turns out she isn't. Satou & Yachiyo confess to each other. And just like that, the ban on workplace dating is lifted. Satou is then sick/has a stomachache for 2 weeks. And after that he's still not fine. Souma working as the sole chef would be quite the hike in workload unless customers are really low. As a child, Todoroki's mom runs a cooking knife shop. And she still does. The shot of her holding a phone looks a bit like Hanasaku Iroha inn reception. There is yet Inami & Takanashi to get together. But it's gonna be harder & take a few more eps since they're hiding their love & her androphobia.

### Episode 12

Wow. It really is the end. Souma and Yachiyo are leaving. Popura will be the next chief aka floor manager. She's the only logical choice since she's been here a long time, longer than Takanashi. Yamada meeting Kotori and "her" awkward reactions were hilarious. Satou would be especially willing to return the favor (of keeping the restaurant running while he's away) to Takanashi since he needs getting together w/Inami. There is a tiny bit of progress in the Takanashi-Inami department, he said he will take Inami to the variety shop, and his mom approves.

### Episode 13

Seems like Inami has a dysfunctional relationship with her dad. The impression of Takanashi on him is also wrought with misunderstanding. After her dad's meddling, and his mom secretly watching, the date is cut short. I thought that they were going to the toy store? Takanashi's mom somehow wants him after work, so isn't going to be walking her home. I wonder for what issue? Souma is scorched by touching Inami. DO girls run hotter? Is Souma carrying more photos in that box? Souma is being pressured by everyone to be part of a group photo. Glad to see Matsumoto include in the group photo. Since Haruna often appears & disappears at her will, perhaps she might magically appear after the photo is taken? It's a small wonder why Yamada hasn't been fired yet since she breaks about 0.5 - 1 dishes a week.

### Episode 14
Since this is a special, I thought that it would be BD-only, but it was quite generous to broadcast this on TV, a 1h long even. There was some dungeon traversing in the preview, so I thought there would be some of that, but none in the actual ep. The previous ep left Inami & Takanashi's date effectively unfinished. The 1st half of this special, various things happen, nothing major to note. Yamada trying to lure Souma with Natto (her favourite food) + trap basket, she caught herself instead, but the entire ruckus got SOuma's attention anyway. Takanashi is cooped up at home and was forced to resign since her mom "hates liars". The manager tasks her to "get my worker back" as a front. But I think she cares a bit for their relationship since she lifted the "no dating" rule for Yachiyo. He's tied up, and Inami has to face his 4 sisters "Scott Pilgrim vs the world" style. They're all cheering Inami on, but there is a "fight" with each one. Most of the fights are easy, except Nazuna. The youngest. If I were Inami I would ask to attack first, then run up & kiss them in surprise.
Amazing that Aoi's mom is Takanashi mom stand in.
Inami lists some "manly" things that Souta has done, and asks for time for him to confess & reveal his true feelings for her, but mom isn't satisfied.

We then conclude that Nazuna asked Souma and Aoi yamada's Mum to get a childhood photo of Takanashi mom. The photo is of their mom, younger, and in a "girly" outfit. This would be used to blackmail collateral, but mom isn't swayed as she is that strong. Nazuna is struggling to break the stalemate. But the Popura arrives with the rest of the sister. She then realizes Souta chose Inami over Popura, which is now good enough for her. Everyone offers their thanks to her as if she were a god. Mom is satisfied now and she leaves for work, with Popura in her arm. Just how long is this night? Souta & Inami confesses to each other in the park, only to have the mood broken by Yamada bro, who was secretly monitoring them. Back at work, there is a celebration for SOuta's return. Its then revealed that the reason for Takanashi mom almost kidnaping Popura is that she likes small things too. Nice of the credits scene to use "someone else" from s1, and show scenes from all 3 seasons, cut to the music.
