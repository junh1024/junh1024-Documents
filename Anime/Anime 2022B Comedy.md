Umio VA NOT Souta

### Episode 1
The show starts with a fun way of showing the premise by showing us a fake advertisement for the store . the storm Mascot reminds me of a yellow giraffe in a leotard. This Show shows us all the hassles that the staff of a manga shop have to go through for example shrink-wrapping books and exclusives together. I like the scene where MC & Hio are alone putting seals on books, but they get worked up saying nonsensical things, but scene is a bit short. I thought that there would be some romance going on between Umio and sensei but it seems to be heading in the direction of Umio and Hio-tan. The sommelier scene was impressive. The manga that the middle-aged man loves might be Shirokuma Cafe. Seems that the sommelier can give a manga rec that anyone likes just by looking at them for a few seconds, though this probably wouldn't work well for music. They have only a small selection of manga on the stage, so maybe the only way to cater to a wide variety of niches to good reception is to have a small number of bestsellers for many niches. Some Japan/Tokyo-specific jokes like Train stations. that's fine, since this show wasn't specifically made for foreigners. We see Sensei & MC drink a small bottle + some red bull, a potentially detrimental combination? Comic carnival 536 s about to start, but Comiket as of 2022 is only up to 100? All the workers are apparently adults but some of them look a bit younger than that?

### Episode 2
Maybe the closest we’ll ever get to a beach episode for this series? Funny how every time she gets hit on the head carried by Sommelier, a set of plasters magically appear on her head. I read that Sommelier is protective of Fu-girls so when she declares that Umio is the best... I thought that Sommelier would be jealous, but Umio is only the "best zombie" to Fu-girl. We have 2 cameramen for this event to get the "best shots" of Hio-tan, Camera for stills & Director for motion. It's very low to bait Camera with a cheap HQ lens as a deal, and even lower when it's a fake. Why go through all the trouble of cheating, since only the task at the end is worth a winner? Sensei is clever & selfish when she takes the prize money all for herself at the end, or does she plan on sharing it? 

### Episode 3
This honya is one of those shops that gets really busy on national holidays. The game that Hio-tan is promoting is called "to Heart". It's a famous drama-romance VN franchise. But instalments 1 & 2 iirc came out in the 2000s. Director makes a really inspirational & revealing speech that today is 1 year after the initial game, so it would be the 1st time seeing their lovers in a year (assuming they completed the game in ai day). The shoppers have the look of love in their eyes. For this episode, the pairings are back in the direction of Umio-Sensei & Hio-Director. Sensei gets forcibly dressed up in a Ruri-lookalike. Hio wants to stick around Director's house after their work afterparty since she doesn't want to be alone. Didn’t know major shops had exclusive contents on Comiket days. Sensei wants to take Umio to a small shrine near her place. I thought it would be a really sus abandoned shrine, but it turns out to be moderately popular. They make a wish. Her wish is "off course" to be a major mangaka, but she also made a 2nd wish. Umio’s wish is "too embarrassing". So I guess it can be concluded that they wished to be closer to each other.

### Episode 6
The first part of the episode a bit boring since they draw Manga and we have already seen part of an episode already where they draw Manga. It's a miracle that Umio can suck up all of their crying, and then the rest of the team can continue working. But it's not shown that text was added to the speech bubbles. I like the second part of the episode better. it shows the strange things that Sensei does to finish her Manga with a humorous Point system. such clear and zoom shots from the cameras, and angles not available if cameras were in the top corners of the room (incl inside the fridge).

### Episode 7
The group is shown leaving Comiket. It's not shown them selling manga. That may've been interesting. They head to a huge public bath with many stalls and parts inside. It's announced by Hio that director is paying. He silently and reluctantly agrees. Charging Is done via a barcode on your wrist so you aren't aware of the high costs until you check out. I guess for usual baths you take off most of your clothes in the changing area but for this you change into a Yutaka since it leads to stalls. The girls aren't aware of this and embarrassment ensues. There are some summer festival standard stalls like koi scooping. This is the 1st time I see shuriken throwing. Hio overhears director saying there is someone he loves, to the crying of Tsumorin. She laments perhaps it is due to changes of herself. No Tsumorin, director sees Hio more often due to work and she is easier to persuade so it's only natural he likes her more now. To note is Tsumorin's unchanging pattern of her Yutaka. Her Yutaka is more of a mask to the pattern. Camera shows her pictures to the director. The DSLR preview screen is only 4:3 AR, but the previous shots are mostly taken from the anime which is 16:9, so those appear stretched. Director points camera's DSLR at her, and wants to take a shot of her since she's not in her own pictures. but doesn't. he should've, IMO. It's back to the shop and they are preparing more display material. Director makes another charismatic rant about how Autumn is the season of Oppai. I was expecting Hio to be moved by it, but she isn't, and continues working. Hio keeps on derailing her own conversation topic, and director makes more absurd rants, and Hio runs out the door, crying. When asked if director was teasing her, she says no, but she should've said yes IMO. It's simpler & perhaps more true. 

### Episode 4
I saw this ep after ep6 since there was an integrity issue. Much better than ep### Episode 6
The staff are promoting one shelf each so they make attractive displays. Camera stacks mangas in the shape of a Greek Pathenon, but how is the roof able to hold up? Hio needs inspiration, so Sensei takes her to a rival manga store, where Sensei buys a lot of manga, even if the cover art is only vaguely interesting, since the books are all shrinkwrapped, and hence can't open inside. Hio eventually finds her manga interests/inspiration of shonen mangas (sports/friend dramas).

A sommelier party, always welcome. The visual metaphors of Sensei losing "girl power", well done. This time since it's valentines, and the focus is on the different sub-genres of romance. The G-man worker is back. The crowd parts in 2 for this infamous character. Like last time, she makes a bold claim, backs up her claim, and leaves with admiration from the crowd. Also the visual exaggeration of Fu-girl trying to follow Sommelier. I thought she might find Sommelier at the top of the cliff, but nope. Sommelier has a lot of manga but he doesn't have this one given to in by Fu-girl. Perhaps he doesn’t usually read this genre. The choice of Manga conveys Fu-girl's feelings for him. It is shown afterwards Fu-girl forgot to give him her Valentines chocolate. It doesn't matter because He is seen holding it up and treasuring it.

### Episode 5
Director is reviewing Sensei's manga draft and he say's there's a "fatal lack of panties". It's not just about showing them , it's also the "situation leading up to them and the characters' reactions". SO he tasks her to set up this year's Spring Panties festival display. Umio helps her get started by giving her some "recommended reading". He goes through some tropes like "Schrodinger's panties". He claims he's "not an expert", but "even I know that". So Autumn is the season of Oppai, and spring is the season of panties? A number of fictional manga is displayed. Although these are fictional titles, with fictional manga, similar ones may actually exist. The two middle ones where the girls are wearing & presenting their panties are highly likely to exist.
In the 2nd part of the ep, the weather is very humid, so it makes the hair of the girls go haywire. Except for Sensei. Fu-girl's ahoges pop up, Hio is all frizzly, and Camera has an afro when her hat is taken off. Recall in ep 3, 11'11" during the Christmas party, Camera has a bar of food under her hat which she takes out & eats. Here, she has nothing (except her hair). Her afro eventually gets tied into two balls. It looks nice. G-man has come to buy some unwholesome books "as evidence", and also wants the "B bonus".
I'm not sure why there's a short interlude film, but notice that the scruffy cat from the Schrodinger shot is featured here.
In the 3rd part of the ep, Tsumorin works temporarily for the store. Umio has mixed feelings about meeting her, as she is the writer of one route for a well-known VN. Tsumorin causes much mayhem by toppling many books since she's a klutz. Hio tries to copycat. They are both scorned by director, and are relegated to a more menial task in another room. Tsumorin and Hio recount their various experiences with Director and notes their experiences are similar.

### Episode 8

Sensei was up late drawing manga, so she's tired and can't perform properly at work. Umio tucks her into bed. She begins working again after she is recharged. She has a chat to the director about her work hours, since she's having trouble managing professional manga work, doujin manga work, and this job. The rest of the staff are under the impression that Sensei is leaving, so they offer her gifts. After it's revealed that she's just reducing her work hours they take the gifts back, but Sensei doesn't want to give up the rare manga from Sommelier. Umio agrees to help her draw manga tonight, but there is a Gilligan's cut to per apartment where he regrets agreeing to draw manga.

- I was thinking if she is drawing manga for work and doujin she could just work once a week.
- The BGM at 6'20" sounds like something from Rhapsody in Blue, but it's just a remix of the main theme.

She inadvertently agrees to go on a movie date with Umio and Panics over wardrobe choices. She can't overdress or underdress. The anime shows a god of roughness with the phrase "I have nothing more to teach you". Recall this is similar to episode 5 where there is a god of panties who also says "I have nothing more to teach you". She calls Hio-tan over for wardrobe help, but Camera and Fu-girl also turn up. To help with ideas, Sensei turns into a man but goes on a delusional rampage. Hio-tan calls a real man over, which they later find out to be Umio, and they show off various outfits to him. Umio complains then she is missing glasses, and she is glad that she doesn't need to give up on glasses for him.

- During the discussion phase, Hio-tan is in a Gendou pose
- Sensei's outfits are: generic maid, Kitakami from Kancolle, a generic school swimsuit, furry cat bikini, and Haruka Amami from Idolmaster. An additional pun is created in English because sensei is translated into master. Idolmaster refers to an actual series. 


### Episode 9
Hio-tan is sick, and she takes a selfie with a very clear readout of the thermometer. Director goes to visit and cooks her some porridge. Hio-tan is being a tsundere and insists he leaves straight after he's done and to clean up afterwards. Director visits again in the evening. She's breathing heavily and unresponsive to a door knock. Director kicks down her door, and takes her piggyback around town. Director says she had an IV drip at the hospital and they just arrived home, but we don't see that. Director stays the night over at her house since he broke the door. The next day, Hio-tan is fine and goes to work, but Director is sick and doesn't work. Due to his absence, the staff have a higher workload. Sommelier and Sensei go to visit Hio-tan. She is still sick/sick again? They give her some manga & DVDs. Sensei is making notes on "girl power", and is seriously mistaken by Hio-tan's messiness. Hio-tan requests sensei to hang up the washing from yesterday. 

Christmas has come and the staff are busy. Director sees Tsumorin waiting in line and is surprised she shows up. She starts crying and the crowd throws director out. Sensei tells Tsumorin that she has been training hard to up her girl power. But Tsumorin tells her to forget everything she knows about Girl Power since she already has the person she loves in front of her.
G-man rides on a moped and delivers books which can't be sold and were previously confiscated. She claims she wants books to abide by the rules, but can't bear to have these ones destroyed. She hands over a large sack to sommelier, which distributes them for free to some customers. G-man rides off. 

### Episode 10
Sensei has made a big mess trying to make Valentines chocolate. So Tsumorin organises are cooking class for sensei camera and Fu-girl. The recipe is just Chocolate cake. At the first few stages, there were some humorous failures. Tsumorin bought out some batter she'd conveniently made beforehand. The last few stages, Tsumorin had not made batter in case they failed, so they just baked some plain batter (devoid of strawberries & cream). A lot of white fog comes out of the oven so I thought it might be burnt but it is perfectly baked. Somehow, 3 cakes are made. The cake is so delicious, that they eat all of it and none is left to be wrapped up. It is revealed that this is a special cooking stage in front of the shop rather than Sensei's apartment. It is finally Valentine's day but since she cannot bring herself to give something to Umio. There is a Time skip to White day where boys reciprocate gifts to the girls. Umio has chocolate balls for most of the girls but nothing for sensei since she didn't give him anything on Valentine's. She squirts cream on Umio and delegates Fu-girl to beat him up. Umio finally gives her some chocolate balls. Camera intended to give director something, but is content with observing and not disturbing others' relationships. Tsumorin encourages her to go forward with the gift anyway, and Tsumorin also has something to give to the director. In return, director gave her a turtle accessory which he attaches to her camera. 

The director dismisses most of the staff for the day. Director takes a call saying that there's more work to be done. Hio-tan overhears the call and decides to accompany him. They head out to buy some food, but as they return they find out the building is locked and the manager has arrived home. The manager said he'll open the store the first thing in the morning. Meanwhile, they go to a hotel to stay the night since there are no more trains. Hio-tan spilt coffee on her shirt so director goes topless and gives her his shirt to wear. As Hio-tan sleeps in bed, he goes over her and says "you're too defenceless" then goes to sleep as well. The next day at the shop, they quickly set up displays. Tsumorin brings them some food and sees that they're a happy couple. As Tsumorin walks home, she cries knowing that director and Hio-tan are happy together and she is finally free. 

### Episode 11


The episode begins with a flashback to their childhood.
- Young g-man looks like Nico Yazawa from Love Live
- The VA is struggling a bit to get the high tone for the younger G-man

Sommelier and his friends are reading H-manga in an abandoned shed, but they're spotted by g-man. G-man tries to run away but sommelier's friends drag her into the shed since she, as a class rep, pose a threat to them. Sommelier presents various H-manga to her but she says she's not interested. G-man is finally happy and responsive to a rare soccer manga and she agrees to keep quiet about this shed. They spend their days reading and collecting H-manga. It's revealed that the shed has a hidden basement which is obscured by a floor panel. One day, g-man announces she will bring some of her brother's crazy manga.
Unfortunately the next day, the teacher has found out about these activities in the shed from a parent and wants to do a spot check of the contents of everyone's bags. G-man has her brother's crazy manga in her bag and doesn't want to show it to the teacher.

- Maybe she can hide it in her bag by putting it horizontally at the very bottom?

Sommelier distracts the teacher with a decoy of a gravure magazine and he is escorted to the teacher's office . G-man runs to the shed and goes to the basement and tries to save some manga. The construction crew doesn't find anyone, and so The Construction Crane starts to demolish the shed above. She's is scared.
The teacher admits he used to view gravure in his age and the content is acceptable. But the shed will be torn down today. Sommelier also runs to the shed. The Construction Crane stops and sommelier rescues g-man. G-man tearfully regrets that the treasures couldn't be saved and that she will move. They exchange parting gifts. He gives her a yaoi manga and she gives him her brother's crazy manga. 

- This is the proper way to do a flashback segment. It was plot, a bit of emotion and a bit of twist. Unlike episode 13 of Oreimo S### Episode 2
Although some details were revealed, I didn't feel much and I didn't care much.

The next segment is narrated by Hio-tan and Tessa and focuses on the girl power of sensei. Unlike a past segment of girl power narrated by director, this one has no score system. Sensei has overslept by a few hours. It's after midday. She eats some ramen and puts the leftovers in the fridge. She packs her bags with equipment and manuscript. Next, she goes to a family restaurant and orders some drinks. She works on her manuscript there because there are no distractions. Tessa admits she also does this. It's after 10 p.m. and there's a surcharge if she orders food now. She's able to resist the temptation. She finishes the manuscript after midnight, pays, and leaves. At home, she finishes the ramen from earlier.

Fu-girl has trouble talking to Sommelier since she's so short. She resolves to make herself bigger. Hio-tan has an idea. The next day, Fu-girl rides piggy bank on Umio and is now at head height with Sommelier. But Umio topples over and sommelier and Fu-girl bang their heads together. Fu-girl is ok, but sommelier is knocked out for a while. Fu-girl kisses sommelier while he's recovering in the nap room. Sommelier touches his lips as he wakes up. The short segments in this episode felt a bit unsubstantial.

### Episode 12
This is the last episode of Denki-gai. Sensei is feeling sick and vomiting. Umio takes her to his apartment. It's messy, so he has a quick cleanup of his otaku stuff. Umio lets Sensei in, and obliges to her requests, as he feels responsible for making her drink so much and thus sick. She recovers, and explore his apartment. Multiple tense situations arise where his cover of a normal apartment is about to be blown. Umio has accidentally left a lewd cushion out, so he gets close to sensei and accidentally tackles her onto the floor, resulting in an intimate situation. But his hand has somewhat reached the butt cushion. Umio has been found out, and Sensei confiscates it.

It's spring, and Director holds a picnic 

- Recall cosplay is mandatory at Director parties.

Director is Kirito from Sword Art Online. Umio is Sadao from Hataraku Maou-sama working at MgRonalds. Tsumorin is Chiya from Gochuumon. Sensei is someone from Yuru Yuri. Fu-girl is fro K-on.

They notice the absence of Tsumorin, and Director explains she's overseas at a signing. Tsumorin appears and says that it was a day trip, and she is here now. The others reprimand Director for deliberately setting the picnic while she was mean to be overseas. It's now clear why Tessa wasn't invited - she is an alcohol fiend. Tsumorin gets the boys drunk, and plays with the girls. Tsumorin finally falls asleep. Umio and Camera have a moment together, and say they're watching over each other.

The ED is a special credis roll, and shows various fictional manga perhaps based on real ones. After the ED is a shortt segment where the manager (we see for the 1st time), starts the day by testign phrases (and poses?!) with the staff,  the Umanohone rap, and short reports from the staff. The staff are then dismissed to start the day. Seems Director is only the director of his floor.

### Writing for VN
Writers for visual novels are important people. Consider the case of Rewrite by Key which is about 80 hours to play all major routes. If there are 8 main routes and 3 writers, then each writer writes about 35h of material. In the case of ToHeart2, the game is shorter at about 55 hours and 4 writers, so about 15h of material. Consider that the average Hollywood screenwriter writes about 2h of material for each movie, this is a big step up in terms of quantity. It's also important to have good writers as bad writing quickly becomes apparent and detracts from gameplay. Multiple writers for a long game are needed for two reasons. 1. To achieve the required quantity of content. 2. To achieve variety since each writer is assumed to write differently based on their own experiences & inspiration. If there are multiple writers, keeping game context (like world description, character relationships) consistent across all writers is a problem, especially for fantasy worlds. Although this is a "charm" point says [rerewrite](https://vndb.org/v751/minireviews#review) .

 
2. Do writers deliver a story or do they deliver a screenplay to the company?


## Hitoribocchi no OO Seikatsu 

![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/94906.jpg)

### Episode 1
- I've read bits of the manga & it has generally good opinions so the anime should be good as well
-  Nice to see that the premise is introduced (Please only come back to me when you're friends with all your classmates).
- She's so nervous that she's holding her bag in front. Jazz band soundtrack a bit like Tamako market?
2 breakdowns in 2 minutes.
- "I wish that elementary school was 9 years long" yeah uhh, very feasible. 
- Her absolutely ridiculous & improbable plans "the school has disappeared/class 1-1 has been abolished". 
- She has made 1 friend in ep1
- Also, Bocchi's VA sounds like Hanezawa Kana but is actually Morishita Chisaki, and is debuting as a MC VA. Perfect for the shy role of Bocchi.
- Some comments online about how this ep was a trainwreck. I found it was OK, and we get to see Bocchi's signature awkwardness in several scenes. But then again I am biased towards this franchise. 

You should know by now that Hitoribocchi means alone, so her name is a pun.

### Episode 2
It's not really said how she got Nako mad.

Aru is being very welcoming, which saves Bocchi a lot of introduction. We have a very long flashback to show how Nako got mad.

- It's so long, are we still in the flashback or not?

At the end of the 2nd episode, she now has a new friend. Aru, "the girl with the obviously fake smile". She is good at making nicknames. She is happy, but her happy threshold is broken by Nako. She apparently has a matching pair of underwear with their mom.
- Assuming her mom is 1.5x the size, wouldn't she notice something when she puts it on?
- Hangar = fashion like Aya style, right? Nako with her hair looks a bit like Serval from Kemono friends.

- Aru on the bars being sad reminds me of Brock from Pokemon on the tightrope after he has a falling out with professor ivy in ep115 "A Tent Situation"

### Episode 3
Bocchi is very sensitive about losing friends to the point that she's re-introducing herself to Nako & Aru. Nako is always teasing her about how Aru's a failure, to which She whips out her "not a failure" sign, which is also a catch-all response to lines that she doesn't know how else to respond. Due to her frank attitude, short & blonde hair, Nako is mistaken by the teacher as a scary delinquent (which she's not obviously).

- A bit like the initial (and continuing?) misunderstanding of Kodaka in Haganai
- Was nice of Nako to give Aru her only remaining lollipop to keep their friendship going, only to have it stolen by a crow. Actual fail. Zannen desu!
- I like Aru's genki/cheery attitude, and her headbutts are funny. But would be a pain in the neck for her if done IRL.

### Episode 4
Going to school is a dangerous task as you can meet many people on the way and have to talk to them. There is this blonde foreigner girl called Sotoka who thinks Bocchi is a Ninja since she is avoiding people. Sotoka is somehow obsessed with Ninjas. Sotoka "understands" Bocchi can't admit that she's a ninja.

- Shouldn't be completely unexpected since this is chuugakkou and chuunibyou can happen.
- Bocchi is funny when she rejects her label of Ninja from Sotoka in English. "no... no... sorry".

But it is all a misunderstanding. Despite this, both Sotoka and Bocchi are going ahead with the Ninja guise as Bocchi is the Ninja master teaching her disciple, Sotoka. And Sotoka won't become her friend until she has finished her training. A big task to ask of Bocchi.



### Episode 5
We have an episode focused on Honshou Aru, which is nice but a bit boring at the end. When Aru shows up with the wrong bag, she fakes a leg cramp to avoid seeing Nako in front, but when Nako tries to talk, Aru's cramp magically "heals" as she pre-empts Nako talking too much. 

- Talk about a speedy "recovery".

Every time a teacher asks a question Aru volunteers to answer to "compensate" for her wrong choice of bag for the day.

- As for every subject, a different teacher arrives in the room, so only the students will see repeated answering of teacher questions.
- Note that the English phrase she reads also has "cramp" in it.
- When she shows up in a full elementary school uniform, I thought there was absolutely no way she was gonna worm her way out of this one, but Nako laughs & her class assumes that's the reason, to make Nako laugh.
- The scene where Aru is trying to make Nako shut up are funny.
- The Tennis match, I thought that an outcome of "undefined" would happen at the end due to technical problems, but Aru forfeits in the end. There's no way that Aru could miss that many serving shots.
- There is an insert song for Aru, maybe for record label support & on a separate Character CD.

Aru is focused on keeping her "perfect image" up, but she realizes that friends are more important at the end by skipping Tennis practice again.

- Also worth noting that in the manga, Aru is punished for her wrong uniform and needs to clean the bathroom, but Bocchi & co help out.

Bocchi has to wait until after-school to get any decent time with Aru, which means Aru is still hanging out with her friends pre-Bocchi. This is fine. So the groups look like this, as of ep5. 

- Bocchi group: Bocchi, Nako, Sotoka (w/o Aru)
- Aru group: Aru, Hana, _FTWIN STAR, Minakawa, _FOHANACLOVER 

So if Aru is vice president, who is president? ED: Kawai Ino is.

- The anime did a good job of choosing some Aru-related chapters to animate info 1 Aru-focused episode. It also did a good job of normalizing the manga character designs into something that makes sense for the anime.

### Names
 
By now, you should know that Hitoribocchi = alone, and Hitori = 1 person. But note the kanji used is 1 star. Aru = there is, so I was wondering whether she might have more meaning in their name. And on MAL, it says "has a true nature" (implying she has one). Honshou Mieru = "true nature is visible". Sunao Nako = "honest/direct child". Sotoka Rakita = "came from outside". Oshie Teru = "I'll teach!". Kawai Ino has no notes on MAL, but it could mean "cute, isn't it?"

### Sound

I'll say Hitoribocchi has good sound editing. Examples. When characters/items are at the sides/edges/off-screen, the voices/SFX are panned likewise to give realism & interest to otherwise what would be a very center-heavy mix. I appreciate this. at 4'18" in this episode, the piano chords are attempting to be in sync with the chord changes when Aru realizes Nako is there. The theme which plays from 5'35", isn't thought to be special, until a minor version of the same theme plays from 6'55" (mode change) to highlight her wrong uniform. Same theme is transformed into Aru's character song from 16'41". The OST is in a band-style. But if you listen to the whole OST, the position of the cowbell across tracks is inconsistent. IMO, we could enjoy the OST more if it was mixed 1-2dB higher. Maybe it's mixed a bit low?

### Episode 6
Bocchi's "Secret techniques" could be anything. When She walks up to the front of the classroom, she gets a leg cramp. And when she goes up to speak her haiku, she vomits, right on cue. 

- Wow, cramps are pretty popular with the students of this school.
- Aru's fail today is quite subtle - a handkerchief as a hair scrunchie?
- Minagawa, we might be seeing a bit of her later on if Hitoribocchi gets further season(s). IIRC there was a bit of her in the Manga.

Nako fails a maths test. Nako says she needs to have a long talk later with the teacher, but we don't see this.

- When you fail a test, you might be given the same test to re-do, which is defeating the purpose of education since all you need to do is memorize the answers (IDK if this is still used in practice). This is highlighted in Sakurasou no Pet Kanojo, where Shiina Mashiro isn't good academically, so she fails tests on 1st try. But after viewing the answer sheet, she can store the answers as a photo in her head, allowing her to get 100% the 2nd time.
- I also thought that Nako would get good grades but apparently not.
- Why is there a target drawing on the classroom window? 

Actually, the teacher wants to be on good terms with Nako too. The teacher finds out that Sotoka calls Bocchi "master", and Nako the "delinquent" is her friend. So thus, Bocchi must be a "gang leader". She wants to make friends with the entire class so she can recruit more "underlings" and do "something big", but somehow Bocchi isn't unpleasant to talk to, and doesn't explain the relationship with Aru. Bocchi's side tail reacts ("expressive hair") when Bocchi is shocked to hear that the teacher won't be her friend. Naturally, Bocchi is sad that the 4 of them aren’t walking home together, so it's a bit of a wait until Nako finishes.

### Episode 7
Bocchi is trying to be friends with Ohana, Aru's friend, by greeting her. But she ends up orbiting around a fixed radius around her, then fleeing.

- Ohana should be a nice person.
- Not having a dedicated swimsuit & instead wearing the school one is fine, right? You don't go swimming every day, not even at school.

Aru doesn't want Sotoka standing too close to her

- OTOH, Nako has a dedicated swimsuit, but can't swim. Where's the logic in that?

Bocchi is being hard on herself since it's summer break & she's only made a few friends. Sotoka's long hair has somehow disappeared. 

At the karaoke facility, Bocchi sees Kai, but Kai runs away and cries.

- Unfortunately, we don't get to hear much of anyone singing, perhaps for copyright reasons. 
- It's explained elsewhere that Kai is afraid that Bocchi might be mad at her.

### Episode 8
- Sotoka. Wow, she even has a shuriken-shaped clock.

- Noticeably absent from Bocchi's support team for her 1st approach to Kako, is Aru.
- When Bocchi runs away from Kako in the hallway, this is the 2nd time we see a ninja run icon on top of her legs.

Bocchi is running weirdly & Nako explains she's jumping over the imaginary hurdles.

- Recall in ep6, Nako saw Aru, but decided not to do a ganbare beam after her failed test results (to avoid embarrassing herself in front of the class teacher). Now, Nako can do a "calm down" beam at Bocchi, but she's not watching.

Bocchi arrives early for school the next day, but the classroom might be locked. It's actually open with just Kako inside since this ep focuses on her & she's one of the role models for this class. Bocchi tries to talk to her after cleaning the desks together. She asks "what's your favorite food", since that's one of her "template" questions. But then she also has written a list of possible response to answers she receives after she asks "why don't you want friends?". Amazingly, she's predicted that Kako wants to "become strong". But after Bocchi reacts to Kako's allegation of "hunched back", her notebook flies into the air & slides down her face.

-  So now Kako may see future dialog prompts & may get the bore of grinding through them.

The other students arrive, & this is the 1st time we get see Kako getting others' uniforms & whatnot up to scratch, since this ep is focused on Kako. Sotoka is trying her best to stay away with shuriken "reminders" from Nako, while Bocchi is busy trying to conquer Kako. Aru is watching from afar. Incredibly, to make up for Bocchi being more absent from Sotoka, she's written a notebook of "Ninja homework" for Sotoka to do. Aru suggests befriending Hana-chan 1st since she's easier, but Bocchi is focused on Kako atm.

- Apparently, Hanako is the last friend for Bocchi to conquer.

Kako is in the class & chuckles while reminiscing at Bocchi's remarks over the day, but stops herself since her aim is to "become strong". Bocchi's persistence is working.

- This episode ends how it started - with Sotoka. I felt like this ep had a bit of confused direction as it opens with Sotoka, but the 1ry aim was Kako. Maybe it could do all the Sotoka stuff in the 1st half, then all the Kako stuff in the 2nd half?

### Episode 9
Bocchi is in a cooking group with Ito, Nosaki and Peko. Bocchi wants to talk but she's having a hard time starting since there's few gaps in the conversation. I know this feeling. Bocchi is tasked with measuring out the flour & sugar, but she makes a big mess & wastes the flour in a cloud of powder. The group is now short on ingredients, so Bocchi decides to ask another group. But She can't think of any group or any one that would give her ingredients. Aru was watching, and turns up in a Festival costume. 

- Except for Ito , I don't know who else is on Bocchi cooking group. Especially the girl worth the ponytail, since there are a few girls with ponytails. Good thing my sub file had this info. 
- Nako implies that Aru has bought the wrong costume instead of an apron, but I thought Aru was in the Festival club. All according to Aru's plan?

Aru gives Bocchi some spare flour. She also gives her a bowl of mysterious batter with the instructions to keep stirring. It turns out the Mysterious batter is actually whipped cream, and the rest of her group looks forward to having it on their pancakes. They dig into their finished pancakes. It is solely due to Aru that Bocchi's group can complete their pancakes and have 3 more people like her.

In the next scene, we see the chicken shed in context for the 1st time, rather than abstract shots inside. Kako appears. Bocchi re-introduces herself, and does a heartfelt introduction of her friends to Kako. She comedically advertises Aru's wardrobe hiccups (hangar & wrong uniform) as Aru's unique fashion trends. Nako has a special place in her heart as she's Bocchi's 1st friend. Kako also re-introduces herself, and her no-friends policy. Bocchi has to keep trying. 

Bocchi bumps into Kako in the hallway. Kako initially refuses to join her "group of friends" to make curry. But Bocchi turns on her waterworks (tears), and declares she's weak. Kako remarks that Bocchi screwed up during the cooking class, but Bocchi responds that Aru helped her. Kako now realises Aru is not to be underestimated when she's able to cover for Bocchi's weakness. The camera zooms in on the floor, and it's revealed that Bocchi's friends were listening from the stairs below. Kako eventually agrees to join Bocchi's curry group, and they continue talking. Bocchi says she sometimes puts Natto in her curry.

- This should be OK since Natto is savoury & should complement the spicy curry & meat.

When asked about curry, Kako panics goes full-out max Tsundere, and leaves.

Kako is determined to make the best curry that will beat all the other groups, which is why she spent a week researching curry. Kako has a made a small guide on seafood curry.

- I agree with Nako, a week to research curry is overkill. Seafood curry, where would they source the seafood? Fish? I guess fresh or frozen prawns could do if it was bought beforehand.

Kako talks to Nako, and Nako says Bocchi has been trying to become stronger, bit by bit.

Even though Aru forgot to put water in the rice, the finished curry is delicious (since it was made with teamwork and love?). Kako, being a tsundere again, doesn't like the " grand prize jumbo shuriken potato", but doesn't want to surrender it, either. Kako has enjoyed the outdoor class today. Kako declares herself as Bocchi's rival. Kako will watch as Bocchi becomes stronger with friends, while Kako gets stronger alone herself. The episode ends, and Kako joins Bocchi and co in the credits. 

- This means that Bocchi has "conquered" Kako.

### Episode 10
It's winter and the end of the second school term but, Bocchi hasn't made any new friends. Bocchi is trying to be strong, but the definition and relative to is debatable. Bocchi & Co go to the shrine to celebrate New Years and pay their respects. They enjoy the stalls and buy some cotton candy/candyfloss but Aru's candyfloss gets blown away into the wind. They bump into Kako and talk for a short while as she has other plans for the day. They also see Ito and Peko, and Bocchi formalizes her friendship with them. Bocchi faints of Happiness.

- Pekopeko means hungry

Peko being the hungry person she is, wants to eat pancakes right now, but Ito says she will arrange a later time with Bocchi. Aru reveals that she has been in contact with Kai and got her contact info at the karaoke bar. Aru wants to take a picture for Kai. But against the incredible odds, the cotton candy that Aru previously lost lands on her phone.

- It's a huge coincidence that multiple people Bocchi knows, including Kai, are at the shrine today.

It's the start of another school term. Sotoka is aghast to see Bocchi address Ito and Peko with the chan suffix, since Bocchi usually addresses Sotoka with san, and Sotoka has been with Bocchi for much longer than those two. Sotoka asks to be addressed by chan, but also wants to be friends (also) rather than (only) a disciple. Sotoka forgot her Japanese in a nervous situation when talking to Bocchi.

- San is a generic honorific and can be used in many situations, but chan is usually for girls and implies closeness

Aru says Sotoka is practically friends already, but she wants it to be formalized. A previous agreement with Bocchi has complicated things. Recall Bocchi agreed to being friends with Sotoka, but only after she has passed on "everything", and they don't even know what "everything" is. Sotoka finally asks Bocchi to be her friend, and she accepts, with a heartfelt hug. Bocchi is touched by her request since it's the first time she's been asked to be a friend.

### Episode 11

It's the start of the new school term. Bocchi is under the impression that she needs to "maintain" her friendships, so she dashes around the classroom and re-introduces herself to her friends so they won't forget her. Nako says that friends will still interact in their pre-established groups. Nako says she's in the smartphone tap-tap group. Unfortunately, Bocchi doesn't have a smartphone so she calls her Mum asking for one. Nako also says there will be a new class composition next year and Bocchi is devastated. She drafts up plans to stop this from happening. As Mayo goes home she picks up Bocchi's draft. Mayo is impressed by Bocchi's "unique" strategies. Mayo suggests Bocchi to buy the school. Mayo calls someone from her limousine to create a suitable job. she returns with a reply of thousand crane service

- Mayo has frills on her skirt and socks which is an addition to the standard uniform.
- Mayo might have a Samsung Galaxy Note7 (2016) smartphone with a flip cover since it's a bit big

The next day Bocchi and her friends fold paper cranes in the classroom. About 100 cranes were collected in a paper bag. Mayo pays Bocchi 500 yen which is about $5. They go to the school shop to buy the school, only to find out 500y isn't enough and the school isn't for sale. It might cost 10 bn yen says the shopkeeper. Nako says it will take beyond her graduation.

- I think it will take beyond a human lifetime if you make 500y/day.
- I was right, a calculation showed it to take >5000 years.

Bocchi teaches Mayo how to fold a paper crane. Mayo admits that students will not be changing classes and so Sotoka can go back to folding shuriken. Mayo goes off to the roof and Bocchi pursues. Mayo confesses that she held back this information because she wanted to keep the status quo of everyone being together since she's lonely. Bocchi reports back to Aru saying that she wants to be mayo's friend but she should have accomplished this with the previous talk to mayo. The 4 friends invite mayo the game arcade and mayo dismisses her butler's limousine.

- I thought that her Butler would Drive them to the game arcade but there might be parking issues.
- her Butler's car is in 3D CGI

At the game arcade, they go to the photo print booth. They are taking time to admire the different options but Aru is getting impatient and takes over. Bocchi says the aim is to take a photo with her friends. Mayo is surprised that this excursion was organised for her, and she has become a friend. She gracefully accepts. The photos are sent to their phones.


- I thought that there would be a physical photo print but it's not showing.
- There are several options for getting the photo onto a phone. In order of likelihood I think: email, Bluetooth, website.

Mayo emails her parents with the photo and tells them she is lonely without her parents. They promise her that they will be back during the next break. This is a good and heartwarming episode about how mayo comes to be friends with Bocchi.


### Episode 12
Bocchi's Mum has brought her a smartphone ahead of her 2nd year. Bocchi proceeds to take pictures of her friends, but also recordings,  to their surprise. Aru starts a quiz, what is the thing that she most wants? Sotoka announces a gold bar. After initially rejecting the answer, she accepts it since she can't think of anything better.

- Sotoka doesn't want the money, likely since her parents are supporting her from overseas
- Obsession with gold bullion might be a UK thing
- I was thinking her actual answer is that she wants to be a more perfect vice-president.

While taking pictures with her new smartphone Bocchi has discovered something big. She saw Katy smile. Her friends agree it's out of character and they all go up to Kako to confirm for themselves. Indeed, it is true. In the corridor, Bocchi overloads Kako with more questions and Kako collapses.  Nako remarks that it's good that Kako collapsed while Bocchi was in her presence.

- But perhaps Bocchi's questions caused Kako to collapse.

Kako is taken to the nurse as she has a high fever. Sotoka is prepared for the situation and quickly precedes to make 1000 paper cranes. There is a small mayo cameo in this shot. They visit Kako in the nurses' office. Kako reveals that her friendly behaviour was trying to hide her inability to take care of herself and they should forget what happened. Sotoka leaves the completed 1000 paper cranes on her bed.

- If you could make 1 paper crane in 5s, that would take >1.5h to make 1000

Bocchi wants to make sure that Kako arrives home safely, so with the exception of Aru they tail Kako home. They make it to her house but she has noticed. They quickly attempt to hide. Bocchi and Nako are facing flush against a wall but Sotoka has bought a plastic sheet to Curtain herself. Kako leaves the favourite movie she had promised to lend Bocchi with her.

- Aru isn't doing this operation since she likely has club activities (Tennis or Gardening), or doesn't want to taint her reputation of VP. 

At Bocchi's house, Bocchi has finished bathing and intends to watch the movie, but the DVD case is empty - Kako still has the disc.

- Hopefully, Bocchi returns the DVD case so Kako can finally give her the movie.
- The movie is called "3 star restaurants". I can't find a movie by that name, but I did find "Michelin Three Stars" aka "Grand Maison Tokyo" TV series https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10845290/ . But the only time the show is referred to "Michelin Three Stars" is on IMDB. Also, The Hitoribocchi anime was broadcast early 2019, but Michelin Three Stars was announced & broadcast mid/late 2019, so possible inspiration seems unlikely.

It's the end of the school year which means graduation of third-year students. Bocchi is nervous about pinning her corsage so Nako offers herself to practise on. The safety pin is quite sharp and Bocchi is shivering while closing in on Nako. Surprisingly, she puts it on successfully. During the real ceremony, she pins it on Karane Nakanai. Bocchi is in tears in the auditorium since Karane is graduating.

Bocchi attempts to invite Kako, as a friend to walk home together, but Kako goes back to her usual Tsundere mode and says she's not a friend. Kako doubles down on the absence of the DVD in the case. She declares she never intended for her to borrow the DVD, rather than forgetfulness. Kako walks away with a blush on her face.

- "Still, it’s quite obvious that she wanted to, but she is embarrassed like any tsundere would. But I guess she can’t admit that she wanted to become friends with Bocchi." [Alternate ep12 review](https://chikorita157.com/2019/06/21/hitoribocchi-no-marumaruseikatsu-episode-12-end/)
- What Kako needs is a little alone time with someone else so that she can discover herself. I propose a meeting between Kako, Nako, and the teacher. Since Kako is in the continued pursuit of being strong, it would be good to ReFrame friendship in the context of being strong so that she's more accepting of if.
 1. If denying your feelings is the status quo, then it requirse strength to be honest to your own feelings
 2. Becky will eventually be friends Kako in the future. Rather than giving in, which is usually a sign of weakness, you can be strong by pre-empting that and becoming a friend sooner.
 3. The teacher after seeing this encounter between two seemingly contrasting people will realise that Nako, rather than being a delinquent, is actually a kind & caring person.
 
Bocchi walks home with her 6 friends (core 3, Ito & Peko, Mayo) to the pancake shop. Nako notes she only made 6 friends last year, so will need to pick up the pace this year to meet her goal by next year. As they eat, Bocchi spots Kai and goes running towards the shop window. Kai has stuck a do-your-best fairy to the window.

- Maybe Ito hasn't called a pancake meet after all?
- During a traffic shot, a BMW X6, DMC DeLorean, and Citroen 2CV are on the road. These are probably rare cars in Japan

It is now the start of the second year. For a change, the teacher asked the students to introduce themselves starting from the back which means Bocchi is first. Bocchi gets sick, mimicking her first-year behaviour.
