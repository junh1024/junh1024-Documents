# Overrated Anime

## Introduction
I've watched anime for >10 years, or >20 years if you count Pokemon & my childhood. I realize now that I am a critic, and I have developed opinions. Everyone's anime journey is different, having watched different anime in different orders, resulting in different reactions based on past experiences. I am entitled to my own opinions, and here they are, as a critic. The definition of "overrated" here, is a rating that exceeds its popularity, or a numerical rating that I deem too high. This document may "spoil" multiple anime series, not just the ones listed in the section titles, for the purposes of comparison.

## Your Name

### Ending
In *Little Women 2019*,  Mr. Dashwood says: "If the main character is a girl, make sure she is married by the end. Or dead. Either way." He's not entirely wrong. In modern terms, this would mean romantic development or milestones.

In our name, they switched bodies, they conquered time & space to save the world (or just Itomori). But all they can muster at the end of the movie is a "Your Name", and only after they pass each other. It's very anti-climatic. VoidEmbracedWitch says this is due to the slight buildup towards the end. I realise that Your Name is the name of the movie, but it is entirely justified to have a more dramatic reaction given what they've been through, and to conclude the movie. In Your Name, perhaps there is *reverse* romantic development by the end.

Your Name is often compared to A Silent Voice, since they were both released in the same year. A silent voice is a movie that intertwines personal and romantic development. At the end of the movie, Shouya can now see the faces of everyone clearly, like a normal person. This is accompanied with a smile from his fiance. Yuzuru goes to school, and Naoka learns a word or two of sign language so she can communicate with Shouko. These are the character milestones accomplished at the end of the movie. While the movie doesn't conquer space or time, the ending's not dramatically anti-climatic, given the subject matter. In Weathering with you, Shinkai's next film, while it has flaws, ends the movie, with a flying hand-hold, something that lovers do, and substantially more concrete than Your Name.

### Music
Another point to compare is the music. In Your Name, there is rock music as insert songs, which I didn't particularly like. It fills your ears, but not your heart. The technical terms for this are bandwidth & harmonics, Audio Engineering folks will know what I'm talking about. In a silent voice, the movie ends on a mix of electronic and piano. It doesn't fill your ears, but it fills your heart. You can *hear* the conclusion in the music. It doesn't continue on into the credits like Your Name.

### Characters
The Characters in Your Name are your "usual" try-hard highschool students. The characters in A Silent Voice OTOH, have a noticeable depth to them. They have their own flaws, some of which are improved by the end of the movie.

### Other remarks
Domestic Japanese audiences preferred A Silent Voice with its honest storytelling, and many people prefer that over Your Name. Shinkai Makoto, the director of Your Name, [effectively](https://twitter.com/shinkaimakoto/status/773752429116403712) said A Silent Voice was better. Critics have said that Your Name was not his best work.

There is also Fireworks 2017 and Hello World 2019 which feature time-travel. Those are also worse than Your Name.

## The Pet Girl of Sakurasou
While it has some nice moments, it gets quite boring in the middle. At the time, it felt like a chore to complete it.


## Konosuba
I dropped Konosuba after 4 eps. It didn't excel at Isekai, nor comedy. At the end of ep4, the curse was lifted soon after it was placed = no consequence for your actions.

## Nisekoi
Nisekoi was designed to have 0 progress to emphasize the comedy. Except that it doesn't really excel at comedy, or drama. Dropped after 2 eps.

## Nisemonogatari & subsequent Monogatari adaptations
The 1st season, Bakemonogatari, was good. XXXN in Nisemon, at the end of the series, just said the curse was fake, and that's how it was lifted, subverting the purpose of their efforts to save her. So everything felt kinda pointless. In Neon Genesis Evangelion and Madoka Magica however, the subversion (of don't become a magical girl) doesn't feel pointless. Instead Madoka has a refined purpose that can best Homura. I guess I don't like that kinda anime.

In Monogatari 2nd season, the start felt slow and boring. This isn't even all the adaptations. There's more series & movies to the franchise, and I don't really feel like watching all of them.

## Oreimo
Oreimo is only slightly overrated. After I finished watching the 2nd season I wondered, what did I just watch? The 1st season is mainly Kyousuke following his sister Kirino going to various places. The 2nd season explores Kyousuke's relationships with the other girls. Kyousuke turns down 3.5 girls, just to be with his sister. Sure, the ending was awkward but we should have expected it give them the title of the anime. What's special about this anime is that the characters are memorable that's about it. I liked Eromanga more. It is rated numerically lower. The premise is a brother's working relationship with his sister. It focuses more on the comedy. 

## AnoHana
AnoHana is only slightly overrated . Menma had one last wish. Her wish turned out to be very trivial and thus the ending was very underwhelming. On the other hand, the ending of AnoNatsu was a bit absurd but more substantial so I think it's better. Both anime were interesting throughout though.

## White Album 2

## Hanasaku Iroha Movie
The Hanasaku Iroha series was good. But I didn't really enjoy the movie and it doesn't add much IMO.

## Henneko
Very mid anime. I dropped it. It got too ridiculous and gimmicky, as if it depended on those to retain the plot & your attention.


## Sakura Trick
I dropped Sakura Trick after 1 episode because the Yuri seemed forced, as if specifically filling a quota. Also, it was boring. For sakura trick, both genders liked it about the same on AniDB.


## Zero no Tsukaima
I don't understand why it's rated it so highly, Perhaps if it's your first anime. There's lots of Tropes but they don't add much value to the show. It's boring and predictable. I think the most memorable scene was when Saito kissed Queen Tristain in an allegiance ceremony. But He kissed her on the mouth instead of the hand. Louise was naturally jealous as she already had a crush on him, But saito didn't know. This is the trope of dramatic irony and it will take another 3 seasons for them to acknowledge each others' feelings, among other nonsense, which is far too long for a boring series.
