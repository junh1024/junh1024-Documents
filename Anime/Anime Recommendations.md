# Anime Recommendations

## Introduction
MAL isn't a good site to get rating scores from, since it's subject to frequent upvote campaigns. AniDB is much better for scores. My interpretation of the average scores are:

- 5: Mediocre
- 6: OK
- 7: Good
- 8: Very good

If it's here in my recs doc, it likely has a >6.5 score. So you can watch them, and most likely be pleased. 

## Biases

I am a male and watch a lot of school harem trash, so my recs will be bias towards males. But then again, so is a lot of anime. But I have tried to balance this with family and other recs. There is also less action and shonen anime. Apparently girls like action but boys like drama. It is also biased towards new series.

## Watching habits
You may see comments like "this series isn't meant to be binged". Actually this applies to most series. This is due to human memory. You will remember more about the series if you watch it over a longer period of time. And this is the habit I suggest. 1 anime episode per day.
