# Anime Recommendations

## Introduction
MAL isn't a good site to get rating scores from, since it's subject to frequent upvote campaigns. AniDB is much better for scores. My interpretation of the average scores are:

- 5: Mediocre
- 6: OK
- 7: Good
- 8: Very good

If it's here in my recs doc, it likely has a >6.5 score. So you can watch them, and most likely be pleased. 

## Biases

I am a male and watch a lot of school harem trash, so my recs will be bias towards males. But then again, so is a lot of anime. But I have tried to balance this with family and other recs. There is also less action and shonen anime. Apparently girls like action but boys like drama. It is also biased towards new series.



## Watching habits
You may see comments like "this series isn't meant to be binged". Actually this applies to most series. This is due to human memory. You will remember more about the series if you watch it over a longer period of time. And this is the habit I suggest. 1 anime episode per day.

## Anime starter pack

1. Pokemon TOS and OL: Ash captures Pokemon and competes in pokemon leagues.
2. Cardcaptor Sakura: Sakura saves Tokyo by recalling destructive spirits into their clow cards.
3. Neon Genesis Evangelion TV series and end of Evangelion. It's the year 2015 and destructive angels threaten humanity. Shinji is summoned by his estranged father to battle them, while he battles his own worsening depression.
4. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya
5. Spirited Away.

These are 5 well-known and often referenced anime that are meant to show a different facet of anime. They were some of the earliest anime I watched.
