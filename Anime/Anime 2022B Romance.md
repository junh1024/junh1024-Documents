### Fuukoi Premise

Students need to pass a marriage practical before they can graduate. Students are paired with partners of the opposite sex and live together in a designated apartment. Sensors in the living room monitor their actions and score points. There is a score display in the living room so that the couple can get near-instantaneous feedback on their actions. Couples that score an A-rank during the month can choose to swap partners if both parties consent. Points are reset at the end of each month so that you don't have a runaway winner which is determined by initial conditions. Jirou has Shiori, his childhood friend in mind, but the author has chosen to pair him up with Akari, to the displeasure of both. But they grow to like each other over the coming months. Romance & drama ensues.

### Fuukoi overall notes
Part of the reason that I chose to watch this anime is because it's similar to [Tomodachi Ijou Koibito Miman](https://vndb.org/v1950) but only in name. and I only know that because I sort of liked one song from it which was featured on the [Panorama 3](https://vgmdb.net/album/32844) album

There was some talk online about how good the ending song and animation were. I disagree. The animation is done in a cutesy minimalistic Style. And the song is generic modern EDM R&B.

There's also some talk online about how stylised for simplistic or colourful the art is. I don't mind as long as the faces are drawn well, which they are. Notice the dotted shading of the background art. This is meant to emulate the halftoning patterns of printed material.

Fans of the Manga are pleased that fan service has been kept for the TV anime. It's mainly cleavage / boobs. This might be important for the premise. 

### Fuukoi comparison with other anime
Akari's pink hair is as pink as Laura La Mer from Tropical-Rouge! Precure which I haven't watched. There're online comparisons to Nisekoi in which a couple is forced to become boyfriend and girlfriend, but this takes it much further to marriage and a scoring system. And hopefully, progress in relationships since Nisekoi was designed to have 0 progress to emphasize the comedy. BTW I dropped Nisekoi after 2 eps or so. 

You could also compare this to Toradora where the two main characters seek to be with someone else but find love in each other eventually. This might be the direction in which Fuukoi is heading. In which case that would be a re-imagining of Toradora. Recall in shinsekai yori that classmates had to choose a project partner of the opposite sex and the narrator describes it as a public declaration of love. this goes a step further by forcing a partner on you.

### Fuukoi Episodes

#### Episode 1

![Jirou kisses Akari](https://storage.animetosho.org/sframes/000f8014_708710.png?s=3)

The episode begins with a coin toss. Pokemon DP ending "Kimi no soba de" also features a coin toss. Aharen-san ep1 has some coin-dropping. but there might be a closer scene in another anime. Akari is slightly tsundere as shown by denying what she wrote down on the fortune. Akari has a hair scrunchie on her leg for "fashion" purposes? 

- We find out that Jirou & his friend are gamer nerds and carry around a Portable game console with them to school, sorta like Keima in Kami Nomi. Jirou has what seems like an oversized Gameboy Advance while his friend has game controllers for a modern smartphone. Akari & her gyaru-crew walk past, so they give way.

- Akari and Jirou find out that they're paired together. I thought that their living dorms would be on the school campus but it's actually 15-30 minutes away. So the only time that they get any "privacy" is when they walk to or from school. At the apartment, Akari boasts that she's better than the generic Shiori. Being a gyaru, she's good at faking emotions, but when she's alone she's just as unhappy as Jirou about the situation. Apparently, some of Akari's whispers were apparently recorded with a dummy head for binaural playback (a la ASMR).


Various things happen in their apartment through the week, but their score always hovers around 0, to the concern of their teacher. They are shown to be in last place in a printout. Akari is trying her best but Jirou isn't really. Jirou did kiss Akari but that was only because Akari riled him up.

- Jirou sees Shiori happy with Manami. He's stuck in a self-fulfilling prophecy or vicious cycle. He is stuck with a girl he doesn't want and can't get enough points to make the switch. The ideal situation would be for Jirou to maintain his relationship with Shiori just like Akari is maintaining her relationship with Minami  so that the changeover is quick and smooth. Just like a performance car with a double clutch or a sports relay race where the next unit is running before the switch so when it occurs, it is quick and seamless.

Akira has a spot of karaoke with Manami while Jirou stays at school. Jirou has a moment with SHiori, who was also at school. At least Jirou gets a bit of time with her even if it's not really meaningful. Shiori has her demure/deredere look on here.


Akari makes Omurice with a love spelt in ketchup for dinner, and they feed each other. They get close for a kiss, but a phone call for Jirou interrupts. Omurice is one of those dishes where you can draw out love with ketchup, as can be seen in other anime like Hanasaku Iroha. 

- Ep1 was a fast-moving ep which introduced a few things, since its the start of the anime. *AirKingNeo* remarks that some scenes felt rushed & thus lost impact compared to the manga. 

#### Episode 2

![Shiori turns up at Jirou's door](https://storage.animetosho.org/sframes/000f889c_14020.png?s=3)

Jirou is still having fantasies of Shiori. I'm expecting partway through the anime he will start falling for Akari instead.

At night, there is a power cut during a thunderstorm, but the scoring system stays on. It could be due to a backup power system, but maybe it was on purpose.

Akari calls on Shiori to take care of the sick Jirou while she goes out with her gyaru friends. They spend some quality time together, but unfortunately, these nice moments probably won't last. Recall in Pokemon ep 112 The Stun Spore Detour" (Nyoromo and Kasumi, Misty takes care of Ash, but with added obstacles made by team rocket.

When Akari is being lovey-dovey with Jirou, we can't tell if that's her true self or if it's just a front, since that behaviour can score points. Over time, it will slowly become her true personality. That's the point of marriage training. When Shiori is being nice to Jirou, that's the real her since there is no incentive to score points, it's part of being a friend. But also, it's her default and only behaviour. Shiori is having trouble being intimate with Tennouji and it's affecting their score. I think we can all agree Shiori would be more comfortable with Jirou.

Assuming score updates are published Weekly I think each episode covers 1.5 weeks since there is a score update part way through the episode and some development before and after. 

### Fuukoi Technology
#### Fuukoi Technology Introduction
I will attempt to overview some of the technology used in Fuukoi based on current implementations. Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on imaging or Machine learning so this is mostly based on stuff that I've read online. There are two pieces of Technology worth talking about here. The door handle, and the activity sensor.

#### 1. Fingerprint Sensor
The door handle with a fingerprint sensor should be somewhat familiar to you if you watch movies, but the way it is implemented in this anime is very aesthetic and usable. You only need to modify how you grip the door handle with an outstretched thumb and takes only 1 more second than a normal door handle. If the students' thumbprints were not collected beforehand, it is still possible to make the system work. You could build a thumbprint profile using say, the first 10 activations and compare future activations using that. It's not a very secure scheme, but it's enough for their purposes, since the apartment is also secured by a key.

#### 2. Activity Sensor
The second thing is the sensor in the room which detects and scores points. The author probably used the word sensor as a weasel-word because they might not know how this would be implemented in practice. So it might be a camera and microphones in the room + some processing backend. This would probably be a machine learning scenario. There are numerous computer vision and audio recognition projects on GitHub if you have a look yourself. It's also possible for a computer to detect the tone of voice or emotion of the speaker given audio input. But what about the cameras/sensors and implementations?

The anime visuals suggest that heart rate is being taken. It's possible to take heart rate at a distance. A [research paper](https://mortenhannemose.github.io/assets/pdf/hannemoseBScthesis.pdf) said you can do it with cheap conventional cameras in only 480p 30fps up close, but it requires the subject to be still & in good view. So, a room camera would probably need to be in 4K. You could supplement this with a thermal camera, but they're very expensive. Also, it can't take heart rate all the time since the people would be moving some of the time. 

If you read the details of Robert's [cat sprinkler implementation](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/ai-cat-chaser-jetson-tx1-caffe/) you see that his camera is configured to output images, but only when it detects change. This is an important point since it saves a lot of processing power since the system isn't processing images when there is no movement. 

Looking at the AWS machine learning product offerings, there is [AWS rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/ 
) which can recognise objects or events in images for video. There are some pre-trained models but you probably want to make your own specialised model for marriage training. It will need to be very well trained on hundreds of different training cases, and a validation database. The system would need to be trained by seeing examples of various behaviours tagged with good or bad, so that points can be given or taken as appropriate. You may need to train video + audio together. Because the last thing you want to hear is "I did bareback sex with my partner but didn't get any points"

## Rec 2006

![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1940/124243l.jpg)

### Why Rec
I saw Koe de Oshigoto some years ago. I liked it, but the anime adaptation was incomplete. Rec is listed as a similar show, so I had that in mind, but didn't start watching it until recently.

### Rec overall comments

There's comments online about how 9 episodes was too short for this series. Currently, it is equivalent to 4 full-length episodes or the average movie. *Rudimentary* [notes](https://anidb.net/anime/7506) that almost every romcom can be compressed down to 4 episodes after watching Amagami SS. This anime is meta at times since it depicts scenes of voice recording for anime. Rec & AoButa and share some similarities even though they are very different anime. Mai has a much deeper and more sophisticated personality than aka.

Overall, a good and semi-realistic romance series, in that they fight, they make up a few times. Some of the things that happen probably won't fly in the current age. Also, rare to find a romance with working-age people nowdays, perhaps.

### SHAFT-ness

As ThatAnimeSnob [points out](https://anidb.net/anime/review/10024 ), Rec was "made in an era when studio SHAFT didn’t try to shove as many head tilts and ... minimalism as it could", which perhaps started with Bakemonogatari in 2009. Although there is a head tilt in e2 11'06" , and the use of large art cards to change the scene.

### Rec Characters
Aka & Fumihiko are the 2 main characters of this anime. There are multiple differences:
- Name length: For starters, there's a noticeable difference in names & length. Aka Onda and Fumihiko Matsumaru
- Eyes: Aka has large anime-style eyes but Fumihiko has more realistic eyes
- Hair: Aka has dark red hair and Fumihiko has black hair
- Clothes: Aka's native clothing is bright, but Fumihiko wears muted workman clothes
- Age & outlook: Aka is 20 with dreams, but Fumihiko is older at 26 with a dull outlook

I think this is deliberate to highlight that they come from 2 different worlds. So when their romance develops, it's more memorable.

Also note in the context of their relationship, Matsumaru Fumihiko is almost always addressed as Matsumaru-kun (last name) but Onda Aka is addressed as Aka (first name). It seems weird and I can't really explain this. I guess we're supposed to just accept/ignore it. Aka-chan is avoided since it means baby.

### OPED Remarks
The OP has a short clip of a (very) old film countdown. The audio editing program seems to be Adobe Audition 1.5/Cool Edit Pro. Your usual uptempo cookie-cutter OP. The BVs sound a bit out of tune.

A window is isolated, then the background changes, is quite rare nowdays. A famous example is the Evangelion TV OP.

The ending however, is much better. A downtempo song with a key change at the chorus. Aka is semi-nude here, I wonder if that means anything. Maybe it's trying to make up for the lack of fanservice in the TV anime vs the manga. That might make sense because the manga has more fanservice. Also note that the cover of the manga has Aka in a towel in front of a mic while she has D-E Cup. But in the anime she has a C-D cup. 

### Rec Voice Acting
In ep1, It becomes quickly apparent to me that there's a problem with the dialog of the male. Perhaps too far away from the mic, bad environment, insufficient processing, bad VA/performance. The performance of Aka OTOH, is absolutely fine. There is a drastic improvement in ep2 for Fumihiko, so no complaints there onwards.

### Episodes
#### Episode 1

The episode opens with Fumihiko being stood up for a movie date. Just as he's about to throw the two tickets into the trash, Aka appears and pleads him to stop. Aka says "please watch me!" 

- When a girl says "please" with sad eyes, you know you have to.
- I thought this would mean that she is starring in the movie but instead, she reads the subtitles in her voice
- From the moment we see her, it's evident Aka has a certain charisma, like Nagisa Furukawa of the drama club from Clannad. She is " instantaneously lovable." Axiom's [review](https://anidb.net/anime/3656/review#r4149).
- The anime starts wierdly abruptly, but works in this case. But also due to the short half-length format

He ropes him into the movie theatre. By reading the subtitles, She claims she is trying to be Audrey Hepburn, the lead actress in *A Roman Holiday*.

- This explains the Hepburn parodies in the OP visuals.

As they exit the movie theatre, Fumihiko spots his actual date going out with someone else. Fumihiko asks for a movie ticket back, but Aka claims she's "not of this world anymore". He is distraught and Aka takes him to a restaurant bar where he drowns his feelings with beer and food. He is doubly frustrated since his proposals are mostly rejected by his company. The pair walk home together, and he promises her to split up at the fork in the road and go straight home.

That night, he has delusions of his crush going out with the other man, except conversations are in the voice of Aka. He wakes up in the middle of the night to sirens and gets out of the apartment. Aka's apartment has burnt down and she is sitting outside on the swings in the rain. She has no one close by to turn to except for Fumihiko. Fumihiko takes Aka into his apartment. 

- I guess this is not an uncommon scenario for someone to have no-one near to turn to if you were trying to make it big in the city yourself.
- When Aka gets out of her house, she must've also taken her wallet too with her bank & transport cards. Otherwise, there will be big trouble in organizing money & transport. 
- There is no explanation given as to why Aka's apartment burnt down. It is simply a plot device to get Fumihiko and Aka closer together. I guess this is acceptable due to the short length of the series. This is in contrast to CLANNAD where Tomoyo moves into the student dorm because his father is a bad influence. Or in Little Busters, where Kudwafter moves in with the protagonist since the girls' dormitory is flooded.

She has a shower and changes into New clothes. He turns off the light they kiss and embrace. The background disappears behind the windows & bed. The next morning, Aka leaves early and writes a note to him. How will their relationship progress today? The episode ends on a partial cliffhanger.

- It's later confirmed in ep2 that they did have sex. 
- The movie ticket would cost >=$5/person, but the restaurant bill might be >=$20/person. Fumihiko's accommodation for her? Ever-increasing value.
- I was a bit worried about the tone of the note, as if Aka was leaving him forever, since I heard "sayonara", which can imply goodbye for a long period of time. But there's plot armor I guess. I note that Aka might not have the keys to Fumihiko's apartment so she could just simply wait until he comes home. That happens at the end of episode 1 of AoButa. 


#### Episode 2

Fumihiko goes to work. Tanaka apologizes to Fumihiko about their missed date, but she is suspicious of how Fumihiko is OK about it. Fumihiko is acting weirdly diligent to wash off his lust of Aka, which doesn't go unnoticed. The company boss has a meeting with Fumihiko. The boss announces that his advertising proposal for their latest snack has been accepted. Fumihiko goes along to the advertising audition/recording with the suggestion of his boss, and finds that Aka also turns up. There were quite a few VAs present.

Aka arrives with her manager & is wearing men's clothes. Seems it was a quick "grab and go" out of his wardrobe.

- If she needs a change of underwear, she can just buy them from a convenience store (as AoButa points out).
- Seems that Aka is with a VA agency, which is usual. 

Fumihiko is trying to stay calm as his colleague points her strange wardrobe. She's really into it by counting beats with her hand. Fumihiko declines to vote. Aka aces the audition anyway, and gets all the votes.

-  It's a conflict-of-interest for Fumihiko to vote, But also since it would be weird if she did a bad performance and he was the only one voting for her.
- I guess practicing narrating "A Roman Holiday" paid off.

 Aka is waiting outside his apartment for him to arrive with a bunch of bought food to celebrate their mutual successes. Fumihiko tries to get close to Aka in his apartment, but she blasts him away.

- The OP now makes more sense with the Nekoki character.
- A solid episode highlighting progress in their professional lives. Fumihiko is behaving odd today. If someone connects the dots, perhaps they'll find out he's got a relationship with Aka. Aka in boys' clothes has a certain quirky charm. Like a subtle badass. tension, perhaps dramatic irony. Aka being a bit tsundere at the end maybe? This anime moves quite quickly, and some semblance of real personalities. Unlike I''s with slow action, awkward interactions, and flat characters 

 

### Episode 3
Aka and Fumihiko shop at a supermarket for food since she has work in the evening, and hunger would affect her performance. It's only a Gaya/crowd noise job. Fumihiko hasn't had Breakfast.

- I guess Gaya is kinda like Walla for western contexts. 
- Recall in AoButa Mai and Sakuta also shop at a supermarket in ep2.
- It's shocking that Fumihiko skips breakfast at least on a Saturday. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 

Fumihiko is busy typing a proposal due Monday and is a bit delayed in opening the door for Aka. Fumihiko notes that he's in a weird state of closeness with Aka. They've only been together for a few days, but they greet and address each other like family. Aka is holding a large brown envelope with her pay. She goes for a walk.

- I would expect in this age that pay would be direct credit to your bank account for security and convenience purposes. Recall that most salaries switched to direct credit in 1968 due to the famous [300 million yen robbery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_million_yen_robbery). After talking to someone, it seems that this company engages in old-fashioned practices, or it's for promotional purposes since there's an image on the envelope, or the author thought it was natural.

Fumihiko is unwilling to go to the arranged speed dating event, but is obliged to, since he hears his boss' voice on the phone. After a short while, he leaves as he realises Aka may return, but doesn't have the key. They greet each other outside on the street. Fumihiko turns on the TV and the ad of the ha snack plays. Fumihiko goes in for a kiss again, and is refused.

- There is a [trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidentalBroadcast) that goes "when a character turns on the TV, something that's relevant to them is showing". That's what's happened here.
- The pillarbox bars on the TV should be black, not grey snow.
- Overall I think this was a weak episode since not much happened, and there was repetition of content within the same episode - the dream sequences and ad from the previous episode. 

### History of Digital TV in Japan

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Analog-step3_wm.jpg/640px-Analog-step3_wm.jpg"  width="320" height="240">

*Example of the letterbox format with digital transition announcement from 2010. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television_transition_in_Japan) .*

You might wonder why the commercial is in fullscreen rather than widescreen. Japan had a widescreen HDTV system since the 2000s based on MPEG-2 and AAC. But in 2006 when this anime was broadcast, many people still had analogue fullscreen TVs and there's still a lot of Legacy content. As a result, there is a mix of fullscreen & widescreen, SD & HD. All 4 combinations have been shown on TV. It's more economic to make a commercial in SD fullscreen rather than HD widescreen, and it was quite common in the 2000s. When a widescreen ad is showing on an analogue fullscreen TV you may lose about 40% of the picture due to cropping. So, important elements in widescreen programs such as credits, should be 4:3 safe.  Not only the sides, but the centre portion is zoomed in slightly due to analogue overscan. In the 2010s, analogue broadcasts were being retired to free up spectrum and adoption of DTV was sufficient. There was also a push for the 2020 Olympics to be broadcast in 8K and 22.2 surround, at least on satellite.



### Episode 4
Aka and Fumihiko have work today. They meet Yoshio, Fumihiko's workmate at a crossing. Fumihiko claims it's a coincidence. Yoshio gets close to Aka throughout the episode. Fumihiko's job is to wear the Nekoki costume, while Aka does the voice work at a promotional event. On the 1st day, there's barely any reaction. Aka calls Yoshioka, her manager, to tell her that she's finished the day's work, but can't get through, so she goes to the office. Fumihiko tags along, as the product manager. Yoshioka says "thank you for taking care of Onda Aka".

- It's primarily for scooting her around the place, but I wonder if there's further thanks like living arrangement?

Fumihiko and Aka eat some sweet potatoes while looking at jewellery through a shop window, and ponder about their future. 

They work hard at their second day of promoting the product. Fumihiko and Aka are pleasantly surprised that a small girl recognizes the character and Aka's voice from the TV CM. The girl does the "umae-ki!" with Fumihiko a few times. Aka is happy.

### Episode 5

Aka is in the studio recording some lines for an H-game.  She is embarrassed and struggling to say some of the lines.

- The game has somehow been turned into a video with timecodes for the convenience of recording lines

They end the session for the day and Yoshioka takes her to a cafe. Yoshioka makes Aka realise that she is very lucky to get a job since there are thousands of people that graduate VA school per year. As such, she must accept jobs and do them properly. Yoshioka suggests she do some practice with her boyfriend. Aka being a tsundere, denies that she has one.

Aka goes to the video shop and rents an adult videotape (VHS) for 1 night. She plays it at Fumihiko's apartment but hastily ejects it and shoves it in his bed as he comes home.

- This anime was broadcast 2006 end the manga was serialised in 2003 when video tapes were still fairly in use.
- I'm assuming Fumihiko has given her a copy of his key since she is in his apartment before he arrives home

Fumihiko notices the lights aren't on which is strange. He takes a shower and suggests that they sleep together as a joke. To his surprise, she agrees. Fumihiko sees this as a signal of relationship progression but is cautious about advancing too fast. He finds the adult videotape inside his bed and is a bit confused. Aka can't sleep either. They get up and Aka practises her lines in front of Fumihiko. 

The next day, Aka delivers her lines perfectly in sync with the video, albeit a bit shy. However, the clients are satisfied since the game calls for a shy voice to match the character. The game finally releases and Fumihiko buys a copy, but Aka prohibits him from playing it.

- The H-scenes for the game are never shown in this anime, and this anime cuts the session just before it gets spicy
- Aka must return the VHS promptly otherwise she may get a late fee
- Recall in Shomin sample, Kimito bought a game with his classmate's VA in it. Since they are physically very distant, he's able to play the game and hear her performance without any prohibitions.

### Episode 6

Aka and Fumihiko are at a live promo event and there is a moderate audience. They get asked to be quiet for 10 minutes since a live cooking demonstration is being held nearby. The chef says the sauce is 3 days old. Fumihiko wants to take advantage of this and tries to poke above the crowd in costume. Fumihiko pushes too hard and causes a big mess with Aka which knocks some cameras offline. After the television cameras come back online, they show Aka and Ha in an embarrassing situation.

- If I made a sauce that took 3 days I'd be pissed if it got spilt in a situation like this

Fumihiko repeatedly apologises to his boss. But thanks to the accident, the sales of Ha and incoming jobs for Aka take off. Aka and Fumihiko now have different schedules and barely see each other during the day. On Sunday, they finally see each other and tackles Aka into his bed for some romance. She's not keen. After a small argument, she announces she'll be leaving as soon as she has enough money. Aka leaves for her Sunday job, distressed. She is underperforming at her voice acting role. Yoshioka suspects she had a fight with her boyfriend, but Aka continues to deny she has one. Yoshioka tells Aka to face her feelings honestly, otherwise her love and work will both fail. She manages to finish her role successfully after thinking about how she greets Fumihiko. But she is conflicted about going back to his apartment.

### Episode 7

His apartment feels empty without her, and she misses his greeting as she returns from work. Aka is sleeping over at the office in the meantime and says she'll get another place during the month. Aka, Yoshioka, Fumihiko, and his workmate Yoshio go to a holiday inn up North in Niigata for a promotional campaign. On the Shinkansen, Yoshioka is a bit worried that Aka and Fumihiko aren't talking to each other. Dinner is lacking cheer. Fumihiko joins Aka in the womens' bath to her surprise. Fumihiko claims it's mixed bathing after 10 o'clock.

- Recall in Rec ep7 6'32", Mashiroiro symphony ep6 20'30", and in White Album 2, there is mixed bathing, but under different circumstances.
- Someone's opinion: at 10pm, there are less patrons. Also, with mixed bathing in one pool, you can close the other pool for cleaning. I guess this makes sense.

They do some small talk, but are interrupted when they hear Yoshio about to join. Fumihiko hurries Aka out of the pools and distracts Yoshio. Aka cries in her room as she is unsure what to do about her professional or personal life. Yoshioka explains to Fumihiko about Aka's situation and doubts that Aka wants to find another place. Fumihiko enters Aka's room to talk about work. The situation is this. Aka has been offered a prominent and year-long voice acting role, but will conflict with the in-person promotions of the ha snack. There is an option of using a recording for the snack promotions, so it frees up her schedule. But if she isn't promoting snacks, then she's not together with Fumihiko. Fumihiko says to follow her dreams so this means doing the recording. Fumihiko offers to let her move in again, so that they can continue seeing each other.

Yoshioka has been eavesdropping and immediately congratulates their decision. Yoshioka claims she has a holistic approach to management. But she is surprised that romantic activity barely happened when they were living under the same roof. The campaign continues without a hitch using her recording. Aka returns to Fumihiko's apartment where she is happily welcomed back.

- If you are making a recording then I highly recommend recording several variations so that you don't get bored of 1 take that gets played over and over.
- This was a good episode in which reconciliation of their relationship happened. If you want to delve into the mechanics of their relationship, Yoshioka is very important. She is the wingman/Cupid/fairy godmother/whatever you want to call it. Rather than Yoshio. He is the anti-Wingman or rival.

### Episode 9
Aka has made Fumihiko bacon, eggs, and salad for breakfast. She's also made a booking at a restaurant for 7 pm tonight since she's getting paid today. At work, Fumihiko receives an email on his phone from Aka that she's landed the lead role in an anime. He's so excited that he shows his co-worker Yoshio but immediately regrets it. Yoshio is jealous that he isn't in the non-existent Aka fan club. There is a new curry flavour for the ha snack. Yoshio's advertisement proposal is accepted by his boss instead of his own.

Aka deepens her voice and successfully voices a male character on her first try.
- It's not uncommon for females to play some male roles. For example, Ash Ketchum in Pokemon is played by females in both English and Japanese Dubs.

She has interviews and meetings after this, but they never seem to end and she misses the reserved time for the restaurant. She's unable to get through to Fumihiko's mobile when he is waiting at the restaurant. Yoshioka says it would be unwise to miss this opportunity. Fumihiko leaves the restaurant and It's absolutely pouring down with rain outside. He gets wet, muddy, and the flowers for her are ruined. It seems nothing is going right for him today. He arrives home and takes a shower.

Aka finally arrives home and has bought some food and beer. Aka is sincerely sorry about being busy, but Fumihiko is mad she's a popular VA and so "anything'll be forgiven", even broken promises, like a princess. But in front of him, she is "neither a popular voice actress, nor a pampered princess."  When asked about work troubles, he rises up, as if triggered. Aka quotes another movie but he wants no more, and retreats into his bedroom. He's sad that Aka is realizing her dream while he is a no-good, no-one.

- The movie quotes have been a bit annoying throughout the series
- They will need to sleep in the same bedroom unless something else happens. 
- Aka is being compassionate while Fumihiko lets out his frustrations on her.
- It would be wise to bring this up with Yoshioka since she claims to have a holistic approach to management. Perhaps she can invite Fumihiko to future engagements so that he is at least near her in the future.
- There is ever-increasing tension as the episode progresses.
- Even though the animation is generally cheap, I'm enjoying the attempt at water caustics when light filters into the dark bedroom, and the water splashes from the outside.


### History of mobile messaging in Japan

*Japanese mobile phones from 1997 to 2004, including a PCMCIA card for laptops. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_industry_in_Japan) .*

About a decade ago, I watched a clip on YouTube of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. A student's email was signed up to 9001 spam lists, and they were effectively unable to use their phone thereafter. I had some questions which haven't been answered until now. 

1. Why email, and
2. Is it their main personal email, or a separate email for their phone?

Luckily, Quora [has answers](https://www.quora.com/Do-Japanese-people-use-email-over-SMS-texting?share=1), so this is mainly from that. In Japan during the 2000s, when you signed up to a plan you probably got some calling minutes and data included in the cost, but not SMS. You also got a special email associated with your phone. But:

- SMS between different carriers is not possible
- SMS may cost extra
- Email is effectively free, since data is included in your plan

So it was a no-brainer to use email which surpasses technical & financial limitations of SMS. This is all second nature to Japanese, but will get second glances from foreigners. Another effect of the [Galapagos syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galapagos_syndrome) perhaps. With the advent of 3G, you can now [SMS between](https://japan.cnet.com/article/35003453/) different carriers, but many people now just use the LINE app for communication (which uses data).

### Episode 8

Fumihiko is at work trying to come up with ideas to promote curry ha. Aka has already finished her Work. Fumihiko leaves early and they go together to a restaurant bar.

- This is the restaurant bar that Aka first treated Fumihiko in episode 1.

A large man leaves the restaurant. They enter the restaurant and they see Tanaka from accounting, crying that her boyfriend has "upgraded" and dumped her. 

- Tanaka as a person isn't that great anyway, no wonder.

The three of them eat and drink together, and it's a tense and awkward situation. At the end of the night, Tanaka is incredibly drunk and Fumihiko takes her home in a taxi while Aka goes home separately since she has work the next day. Tanaka lives in a luxury apartment suite. It's taking longer than expected since Tanaka is trying to seduce Fumihiko with the premise that Fumihiko once loved Tanaka and intended to go on a movie date with her.

His phone rings and He assumes it's Aka but it's actually Yoshio who is working overtime at the company, so he has to fake an excuse that he has a cat called Aka. He eventually gets a call from the real Aka but his battery runs out before he's able to answer it properly. In the end, he stays overnight.

The next morning, Fumihiko and Tanaka go to work and are tailed by Aka in Disguise. Aka gives Fumihiko a change of clothes. Fumihiko is worried about his relationship with Aka so Tanaka calls Aka saying that nothing happened between them last night since she's "only into macho men". She Takes Fumihiko drinking again as a reward but this time when Tanaka is drunk, he takes her home to his apartment. It's another awkward situation as the three of them sleep together.

- A filler-ish DVD-only episode, with events not acknowledged in the next ep.


### Episode 10

The next morning, Fumihiko wakes up, looking scruffy. Aka has made him sausages and eggs for breakfast. She has a post-recording session party today. He wishes to apologise, but somehow, the words that come out of his mouth anger Aka more. He even goes as far as to offer Aka to move out, and lies about his true feelings. At work, Fumihiko is depressed. Yoshio offers to take him drinking.

They drink their hearts out at a restaurant, but overhear Aka nearby. They flatten the partition dividing the parties, and introduce themselves. Aka finally learns Fumihiko has work troubles. Other party members also talk about their troubles. They reconcile at the party while continuing to hide their relationship. Yoshio and Fumihiko walk out of the restaurant, but Aka has waited for him. Fumihiko runs to her and they embrace, as a confused Yoshio looks on. Yoshioka drives Yoshio home.

- It's a miracle that Yoshio hasn't figured out that Aka is his roommate even though all the excuses & close calls
- The lighting changes to light greys as they walk home, and Normal night lighting resumes when they get home

During the walk home, Aka is asked to be his girlfriend. She accepts. They warmly welcome each other home again. The episode and series ends.

- Some new piano-based pieces debut during this ep to cover Fumihiko and Aka's final reconciliation
