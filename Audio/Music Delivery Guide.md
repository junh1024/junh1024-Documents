## LUFS
- LUFS is NOT a peak standard. Thus, very dynamic audio with high peaks, can have the same LUFS as a compressed audio with low peaks.
- There are products that claim to limit your audio to X LUFS. But I don't trust them to fully preserve dynamics. 
- The best way to target LUFS is to use a master gain FX to aim for your LUFS target. A few LUs over/under is acceptable due to variations over the program.
- Media platforms may have LUFS specifications. The platform may further adjust loudness to meet their specifications.
- Do NOT export multiple specific LUFS-targeted files. The platform will check & may change the loudness. Export ONE file for all platforms. The exception is for video-only playforms like YT & vimeo. Then you need 2 files. The video file should ideally be automatically generated from your audio-only file.
- Choose a sensible LUFS target for your program.
