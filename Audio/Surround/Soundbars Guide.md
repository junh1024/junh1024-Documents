# Soundbar buying guide

## Introduction

If you want to buy a Soundbar, you want to upgrade your TV audio experience. We assume you already have a TV. The advantage of a Soundbar over a traditional AVR plus speakers setup, is that there's less hassle and less wires, but also less functionality. You could also buy speakers plus a small control box like Logitech surround speakers as long as optical-only input is OK, or you're using it with a PC which has 3.5 mm analog out. Conversely, soundbars can also be used with PCs as long as the PC has HDMI out. Note that some LG, Samsung, and Sony soundbars have exclusive options when paired with the same brand TV, detailed in their respective sections.

## General points

The basic 5.1 soundbar with rear units has >= 3 drivers in the front unit for LCR, and 2 wired units with a driver each for surround. The sub might be in the front unit, as a separate unit, or none. From there on, vertically angled drivers can be added to the front &/back to produce reflected height sound when heard from the sweet spot, and horizontally angled drivers for side/wide speakers.

The rear speakers communicate wirelessly to the main unit, and that's a common source of complaints. Potentially not all soundbars can upmix stereo to surround, so please check if this is important to you. Connectivity and codec support also differs, and depends on your current infrastructure, so again, check info online.

The point of buying a soundbar is to improve on the experience that you already have. If you buy a soundbar with only a front unit, regardless of whether it has Dolby Atmos technology or not, your experience won't really be improved, since you'll still be mainly hearing sounds from the front, and it's generally hard to produce a convincing sensation of sound from behind, unless you actually have speakers there. So I would recommend in general to only buy soundbars which have rear units. I would also advise against buying soundbars with detachable/battery-powered rear units, as it can be annoying to charge them and batteries degrade over time. *ahem* JBL *ahem*

Case study: Mr S bought a cheap soundbar from Amazon when they already had a soundbar with virtual surround. Having physical rear units was an upgrade, but in terms of front imaging, it was a downgrade. The front unit was so small (15" wide) that there was little physical separation between left and right, so the sound field was a trapezium rather than an expansive rectangle. There could also be timbre, volume, and reliability issues with budget soundbars. So don't go too cheap/small.


## Vizio

*Vizio V-series 5.1 soundbar*

Vizio has a range of soundbars, you can read about them [here](https://www.rtings.com/soundbar/reviews/vizio) . Also, Unless you're in the US, you'll need to import it, Vizio is better for US consumers.

The [Vizio V-series 5.1 soundbar](https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-Bluetooth-Subwoofer-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B08CGVTVMN) is a reasonable price at about $200, and the minimum quality that I would suggest. If you want height, there's a 5.1.2 soundbar. The 5.1.4 elevate soundbar is the top end model, but the speakers which elevate up or down depending on the content is a bit gimmicky IMO.

## Sony HTA Premium

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ux67+na6L._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Sony HTA9" width="480">


When the [Sony HTA9](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-HT-A9-Performance-Multi-Dimensional-Experience/dp/B099Z93KL7/) came out in about 2022 it got rave reviews. It's suitable for small homes, and you get good sound. Don't Skip the calibration - that's how it makes good sound. From Amazon reviews the wireless signal can be unreliable at times. Also, it's missing an Optical Port so you may have trouble connecting legacy devices. It retails around $1800

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IM6pnPFOL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Sony HTA9M2" width="480">

In 2024, the [HTA9M2](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-BRAVIA-Theater-Quad-Speakers/dp/B0CZ7MGY3H/) came out, a newer, more expensive model with an updated design. Rather than 4 cylinders, you have 4 slim squares. This [manga](https://scs-uda.com/ht-a9m2-review.html) of the Sony soundbar the new version is lighter, and more seamless when wall-mounted. The wireless connection has [been improved](https://www.sony.co.uk/store/product/hta9m2.cek/BRAVIA-Theatre-Quad-Flagship-Home-Theatre-System-360-Spatial-Sound-Mapping-Dolby-Atmos-DTS-X) . Customers say the setup process is (more) painful and requires an account, and it's obviously very expensive, but the sound is fantastic. It retails around $2500

Overall, there are mixed opinions whether it really is better than the old HT-A9. [Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cn7sw7Cb6k) said the sound was fuller on the HT-A9M2, but [Cade](https://www.whathifi.com/features/as-a-user-of-the-sony-ht-a9-dolby-atmos-system-im-both-disappointed-and-relieved-by-the-imperfect-bravia-theatre-quad) said the sound the HT-A9M2 needed a sub to sound good whereas the HT-A9M didn't.

## Sony Standard

<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+2fpZ6oDL._AC_UL232_SR232,232_.jpg" alt="RS3S" height="80">

Sony and Samsung both offer front soundbars and you can buy wireless rear speakers to make a complete sound system. This lowers the apparent price for consumers, but it's more difficult if you want to find A soundbar with physical rear speakers. An example combination is the [HT-S2000](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-HT-S2000-Soundbar-Bluetooth-Technology/dp/B0BWLCLZPS/) + [RS3S renewed](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-SA-RS3S-Wireless-Speakers-HT-A7000/dp/B0CV5VGPWH) which is around $750 in total. Although at this price, you can buy a soundbar *with* included surround units, *and* have DA & height drivers. Sony things are expensive, you could perhaps say it's a joke. Ridiculous, innit?

With some Sony soundbars, you can use a Sony TV as a physical Center channel with S-Center out.


## Samsung Standard

Samsung's standard soundbar offerings range from 3.1 with [the B650](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B359G4BY/) to 5.1.2 with [the Q800](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-HW-Q800C-Soundbar-Q-Symphony-Subwoofer/dp/B0BVWG9GH9), front unit only, starting from about $370. If you want rear speakers, you'll need to buy them extra, like the [SWA-9200S](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-SWA-9200S-Wireless-Speaker-Renewed/dp/B0B96VX546) for about $120 refurbished, and ordering them might be a bit hard from physical stores. Sometimes you can find packages on Amazon if you do [a search](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=swa+9200s&i=electronics&s=price-desc-rank). 

Samsung Q-Symphony can use the speakers of your TV in addition to the soundbar speakers for a more impressive experience, but the feature is restricted to Samsung TV models >=2020. You can perhaps pair rear speakers with Q-Symphony. Candid opinions on Q-Symphony [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Soundbars/comments/ih5np7/is_samsungs_qsymphony_worth_it/)

## Samsung Premium

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zwD5+zgaL._AC_.jpg" alt="Samsung Q990 soundbar" height="240">


It seems that only Samsung's flagship soundbars like [the Q910](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B358YLFJ/ref=twister_B0BLGR3J5F) with 9.1.2 (starting from about $750) offer included rear speakers. Models from Q950 have 4 height speakers. Again, you can use Q-Symphony with select TVs. 

## LG
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71K9fAi3qCL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg" alt="LG S95QR" height="240">

The [LG S95QR soundbar](https://www.amazon.com/LG-Sound-Surround-Speakers-S95QR/dp/B09RZ691X1/) with 9.1.5 for about $900 is an interesting proposition since each rear unit has two ear-level drivers for a dipole 5.1/7.1 experience. Unique to this soundbar is an extra upfiring speaker for the center channel (hence 9.1.5). And similar to Samsung, this LG soundbar can be used in unison with select LG TVs, a feature called "WOW Symphony". Most reviews said good sound, but a common thread through the reviews was that app is frustrating to use, and no OSD.


## Nakamichi Soundbars

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media-library-service-media/cdb18c6e-a7bd-4c1b-872f-97f9f8dc39f8.__CR0,0,1200,1350_PT0_SX200_V1___.jpg" alt="Nakamichi 9.2 SSE" height="320">

The Nakamichi Dragon 11.4.6, which costs $4000, is a [Self-proclaimed](https://dragon.nakamichi-usa.com/) "Undisputed Champion" of channels/money, as it's cheaper than a dedicated AVR plus separate speakers. But the look and concept is a bit too imposing for my tastes. The surround units are implemented in a dipole-like way with 2 orthogonal drivers.

Perhaps a better and cheaper option would be the Nakamichi Shockwafe Ultra 9.2 series starting from about $1100. First for the Shockwafe 9.2, is that it has 4 surround units for a very physical 7.1 experience. But, it seems that there are no specific drivers for height, so height is virtual. The Shockwafe 9.2 comes in 2 versions, the [regular SSE version](https://www.amazon.com/Nakamichi-Shockwafe-Soundbar-Subwoofers-Technology/dp/B07HHZ94BW) with ARC, and a [eARC version](https://www.amazon.com/Nakamichi-Shockwafe-Soundbar-Subwoofers-Technology/dp/B08Z37YTVG/) with improved drivers.
