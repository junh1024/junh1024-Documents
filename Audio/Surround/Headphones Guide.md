# Headphones Guide

## Introduction 
Since I specialise in audio, many people have asked me for headphones advice over the years, but I'm not prepared. There's also some information about headphones that I've gathered over the years (AKA mainly just the last half year) so this document serves to collect that info.

With headphones, it's potentially cheaper than speakers to get a higher quality sound. Also, more details are revealed since the drivers are closer to your ear, and are less affected by poor acoustics. But the sound is more unnatural since the imaging is inside your head instead of in front of your head. Also, headphones lack crossfeed, and thus technically are [not stereo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ9WQDojQt8) . Room simulation software can help, but it's imperfect and highly subjective. It's also easy to deliver high amounts of power through your headphones (esp earphones) and damage your hearing over time. So still not a complete replacement for speakers, and will affect critical judgement, among other things.

This document will go over some general concepts, and is intended to be a starting guide to headphones for a general audience, not a audiophile or enthusiast audience. So I'll suggest some common models and things I've tested. This should be supplemented with your own research. This document will focus on a music context with mixing considerations, and sometimes business/communication context as well. Also with a large section on surround. Approx prices are included, but can vary due to condition, currency, and discounts. Buying from the vendor's own site could be cheaper.

This [Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1rsawp/parsing_headphone_reviews_aka_how_to_cut_through/) will tell you how to interpret subjective headphone reviews, but hopefully you won't need that since I'll be using relatively straightforward language. That system was made about 10 years ago. But now, if you have a bunch of reviews of a single product, AI summaries are sometimes useful at summarizing common points.

## Factors when choosing a headphone

The perfect headphone should have a balanced sound including sufficient bass and treble. It should be light and comfortable to wear. Which would mean not too much pressure on the ears, and not too hot. And perhaps good noise isolation. However, some of these attributes are in direct conflict with each other, which I'll explain below, so it will be hard to get the perfect headphone. The design and type of headphone will also influence these factors.

The frequency response is an important factor to headphones, and can be changed with EQ afterwards, but EQ can only go so far, the response cannot be boosted if there was no response in that region for cheap equipment. Also, it may not be convenient to implement EQ in every situation or if you're switching between multiple devices.

The sad truth is that all headphones would break eventually. It's not a question of if, but when and how. The design and quality of the headphones is going to influence this. Chinese stuff is probably worse. It's common for the cable to come apart at the joints - near the drivers, mic, and plug. Also, the fabric and covers can separate from the cups. Foam ear cushions break quickly. But at least they're easy to replace, if you can buy replacements. Be prepared for headphone breakage and have a strategy.

I'm not very fond of wireless headphones since the batteries need charging, and batteries degrade over time. There's also issues with [codec compatibility and quality](https://www.soundguys.com/understanding-bluetooth-codecs-15352/) between different headsets and phones 

### Open-back vs closed-back

This refers to how tightly the ear cup presses onto your ear. Open-back headphones have a loose seal around your ear so that you can still hear sound around you, with little isolation. The sound is more natural and open. The benefits are that you can eat and talk while wearing open-back headphones, and you won't hear amplified sounds from your Cranium. But open-back headphones typically have weaker bass.

Closed-back headphones have a tight seal around your ear and the ear cup presses against your head, but as a result, your ears & head get hotter and it's more uncomfortable to wear. The advantages are increased noise isolation and bass. Sean Olive [did a tweet](https://vxtwitter.com/seanolive/status/1630389960904957953/photo/1) , closed-back has more variation in bass than open-back,  (not the tweet I was looking for but you get the point) 

In-ear earbuds are basically closed-back, but will have less head discomfort, but some people disprefer the sensation of earbuds. There's also the factor of earwax buildup. What I use depends on the environment in also how I'm feeling at the time.

## Personal History

![Example of behind-the-head headphone](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61s4nkUOT1S.__AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg)

The concept of owning high-quality headphones purchased by myself is foreign to me. Growing up, my funds were limited. So I bought budget gear from my local retail store, and when they broke I need to buy a new one. This would typically be TDK earbuds (not EB-550 but similar orange packaging) or a budget behind-the-head headphone. The latter's ear cushion wore out over time, and they finally broke, leaving exposed plastic. They're technically still usable, just very uncomfortable.

I'm currently using some hand-me-down equipment which is "OK". A Budget Panasonic & gaming headsets, and budget Samsung & Chinese earbuds. I'm hesitant to buy more since I'd be adding to the pile of junk. Also, I've realised I've not used any headphones or earbuds longer than a few years.

## Headphone categories and reviews

### Samsung EHS64

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51noDSD2J0L._AC_SL1000_.jpg" alt="Samsung EHS64" height="240">

The [EHS64](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-EHS64AVFWE-Stereo-Headset-Remote/dp/B00D8YYY0M/) are the earbuds that came that come with some Samsung phones in the past. They sell for about $7. If I were writing this about 15 years ago, I might have been reviewing Apple iPod earbuds. I thought that iPod earbuds had sufficient bass, until I tried the Samsung earbuds.

Due to the in-ear design, there is some bass, but I feel like there's a sharp roll-off somewhere. It has strong mids, so if you're mixing on this exclusively then you'll definitely get the vocal balance Wrong. And the treble is a bit weak.

A slight advantage to that bass highpass, is that when it's charging you don't hear the hum. On some head gear with bass you may hear some hum while charging. There's an updated version of Samsung earbuds (EO-EG920) which just sit on your ear and have more bass whilst rejecting some of the charging hum.

I have some pink Chinese earbuds which I'm not sure of the make or model. They have sufficient bass, but slightly lacking treble. Also, it has a microphone that's broken or not functional. Decorative microphone controls seems to be common for very budget earbuds. This is actually a problem since if you want use a microphone, you need to disconnect the earbuds from your phone.

### Huawei CM33
As other reviews on the internet will point out, even though they're earbuds (and hence open-back), they have a surprisingly decent amount of bass. The mids are okay, and treble might be just a tad weak. These are USB-C earbuds so the intended use-case is obviously a phone with only a USB-C port. There are some usability issues though. The plug is made of glossy plastic, so you might find it a bit hard to pull it out. Also, the ear units are also glossy plastic with no silicone cover, so they hang loose in your ear.

### Panasonic RP-HT161

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N0YijxlcL._AC_SL1200_.jpg" alt="Panasonic RP-HT161" height="240">

The Sennheiser HD 201 or 202 or whatever cheap model by Sennheiser these days has been a benchmark for budget/medium headphones for many years. But I can't seem to find it for sale here. So the [Panasonic RP-HT161](https://www.amazon.com/panasonic-headphones-rp-ht161-k-lightweight-long-corded/dp/B075LT8YLR) is the next best thing.

These headphones were bought since they were cheap and on sale for about $20. These are open-back headphones. They're light and comfortable. Although the headband has gone a little loose and the ear coverings have worn off leading to warmer ears. The cable is ample distance at 2m long.

Although the box claims extra bass, the bass is a bit weak. The treble is strong, perhaps a bit harsh on some pop. So if you have too much treble in your mix, you'll definitely notice. But otherwise, decent for the price and fine for mixing midrange & highs.



### Sennheiser HD300

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51I5eGp-8UL._AC_SL1312_.jpg" alt="Sennheiser HD300" height="240">

[These](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Over-Ear-Closed-Back/dp/B07N22BN3K/) are closed-back headphones, so they can get hot and sweaty. The headband folds for more convenient storage and transportation.

### OEM Gaming headphone

In Jan 2024, I got some headphones for free but they're not that great. It's OEM "gaming" headphones, and they look similar to the [Somic G936](https://www.amazon.com/SOMIC-G936-Commander-Gaming-Headset/dp/B07CFWQ68Y), except with less features. It has 2x 3.5 mm jack for PC audio and microphone connectivity. The USB jack is only for RGB lighting, and there's of course no virtual surround since there's no software.

It's a bit heavy in weight, and clearly not made for music as the bass is definitely lacking. Although if you're playing combat games, then reduced bass could protect your hearing.

Perhaps the only saving grace is the good noise isolation due to its closed-back design. So, the way I use it typically, is my Samsung earbuds + gaming headset, which gives quite good noise isolation. As of mid 2024, I'm using these directly, and with a bass boost, mid cut, and treble boost in [voicemeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm), it sounds better, but still not great.

### Other budget headphones

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FRJHB7XOL.__AC_SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg" alt="Razer Blackshark" height="240">

For cheap headphones with good bass, there's not a lot of choice from big brands. If you want bass for this price, you might need to go earbuds, as they're effectively more closed than closed-back.

Razer Blackshark V2 seems to be closed-back. It claims to be light & comfortable, and offers USB & 3.5mm versions. It has a mic too. But I'm not sure about music use. It's also cheap at $50.


### Somic headphones

In about 2018, I got some Somic headphones which look similar to the [Somic V2](https://www.amazon.com/Over-Ear-Monitor-Headphones-Professional-Headphone/dp/B07FZXKSHK/) , except the cups/driver were probably a bit smaller and I don't recall any 6.5mm adaptor or curly cable. You can fold the cups flat. It came in a big red box. I remember the sound had slightly more bass than I was used to, but there were audio dropouts due to a broken cable after a few years, effectively making it unusable.


### Noise-cancelling headphones

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L7RzkIO1L._AC_SL1024_.jpg" alt="Razer Hammerhead USB-C ANC Earbuds" height="240">


There are plenty of wireless noise-cancelling headphones, but It's somehow very hard to find wired ones. The most you can find this noise-isolating headphones which is basically closed-back. The most I can find is wired noise-cancelling earbuds powered by a USB-C. Unfortunately, I had to use AI to get these suggestions, then filter out nonsense ones.

## Business headsets

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cw-o0HdNL.__AC_SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg" alt="SC75 headset" height="240">
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HLAk95HfL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="C3225 headset" height="240"> 


There are some business headsets available for sale. They have a mic on a boom, and a USB connector with a dongle where you can change the volume, mute the mic, and accept/reject calls. With some of them, the dongle is detachable, so you can use it as a regular 3.5mm headset as well. I've tried 2 of these.

The [Sennheiser SC75](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-SC-75-USB-MS/dp/B01LXRR799) has mids, but no bass and reduced treble, so not suitable for music. After a "fair number of years used for business", the fabric over the cups is getting loose, so I need to keep on pulling the fabric over the foam underneath to prevent it from totally falling apart.

The [Plantronics/Poly C3225](https://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-209747-22-Headset-Passive-Reduction/dp/B07CVGNBMM). The dongle lights up when mute is pressed. It has very strong bass and reduced treble so suitability for music depends on your preferences. Both of these sell for about $60


## High-end headphones


<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UiSpcctDL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Beyerdynamic DT770" height="240">
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-02EMdPzL._AC_SL1100_.jpg" alt="Audio Technica ATH-M50" height="240">


The [Beyerdynamic DT770](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079P9H1SH) , [DT880](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079P9H1SH) , DT 990 & [Audio Technica ATH-M50](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B016YJDV74/) have been a benchmark for many years as well. Both sell for about $160

With the rise in popularity of spatial audio, some manufacturers have been making headphones for spatial mixing purposes. Like the [Sony MDR-V1](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Open-Reference-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B0C4YY6WXX/), or the Ollo S5X, priced about $500 each. B-stock versions of the S5X are available from the vendor for cheaper. But if you want even cheaper products, you might as well just buy regular headphones.


### Phone DACs
You would be buying USB-C to 3.5mm adapter if your phone only has a USB-C port, but regular listening gear. You wouldn't need to if you bought a good phone in the first place like the Sony Xperia 1 (perhaps used can be cheaper). Some phones May reject certain adapters. For example, Samsung phones May reject headphone + charging port adapters, even though these are a common type of adapter which support headsets with microphones. So it's important to do your research.

Adapters vary in amplification, so high amplification would support headphones with higher impedances. On the Flipside, it's possible to have an adaptor with too much amplification when low-impedance earbuds are used. This would cause the volume to be too high at the lowest volume step, requiring installation of EQ to turn down the volume further. Too much amplification may also generate heat and draw battery faster.

### IEMs

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g4PM8mrxL._AC_SL1080_.jpg" alt="Truthear Hexa" width="240">


IEM stands for in-ear monitor. The idea is to have a larger driver outside your ear, and the sounds are directed to our Canal which goes inside your ear for better sound and increased isolation. Note comfort can be an issue for IEMs if you're not used to them. It may also depend on the specific model.

Many people might be getting the [Salnotes Zero](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/7hz-salnotes-zero-universal-iem.25980/) or Moondrop Aria 2 or as their first budget chi-fi IEM for $40 and $80 respectively. Moondrop also has other IEMs and earphones which can be as low as $12.

But anyway, the product that has gotten the most hype recently is the Truthear Hexa which costs about $80. It boasts a natural timbre with a slight bass boost. It's received near-universal Acclaim and a breath of fresh air with its sound. Note that these are multi-driver IEMs. BTW, the waifu on the front looks like Murakumo from Kancolle. 

IEMs often have detachable cables. This will be a new concept for those used to regular earbuds. This is another layer of complexity, but it could have some benefits. So usually if you yank on your earbud cables or have them caught up somewhere, this could lead to a volume imbalance between the channels, and won't be resolved until you buy a new set of earbuds. This has happened to me a few times. But if you have IEM with detachable cables, the cables could detach themselves just like a MagSafe connector. The included cable with most IEMs often don't include a microphone, so you can add that feature by just buying cables with a microphone.

There's 2 common types of cables for IEMs, 2-pin and MMCX. Both have [their quirks](https://www.head-fi.org/threads/mmcx-vs-2-pin-which-is-better-and-why.728962/#post-12893514). 2-pin seems more straightforward. [Pictures](https://www.head-fi.org/threads/the-different-types-of-iem-connectors.938264/) . This [Linsoul cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TLBGQLB) is available in multiple types and has a microphone and controls, but some people think it's not durable. [Wired cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8Q82T3T) from Linsoul is also available.


### KZ fake driver controversy

Maybe worth mentioning here a few years ago, Delta Fyre made a Post in which he disconnected some drivers of a KZ multi-driver IEM and found out that some of the drivers barely made any sound. Lots of drama ensued, and the famed headphone reviewer crinnacle discontinued their relationship with KZ. KZ later made a statement [with technical explanations](https://www.headphonesty.com/2022/03/kz-fake-multi-driver-iem-scandal/) and that the product is working is expected, and Delta Fyre made an apology. But not many people read the follow-up statements.

Delta Fyre expected the multiple drivers to have exclusive frequency ranges, but they were overlapping frequency Ranges - the other drivers were used for tuning purposes. Also, their testing method was potentially invalid since disconnected drivers form an open circuit and changed the topology. Multiple drivers were also likely done [shorten product development time](https://old.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/ux2q5w/whats_the_current_situation_on_kzs_fake_driver/i9vbqom/)

Drivers of KZ IEMs could be connected with the wrong polarity. This is a more valid claim than "fake drivers", and highlights QC and potentially [significant build quality](https://old.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/ux2q5w/whats_the_current_situation_on_kzs_fake_driver/i9vbqom/) issues.

Either way, you should try you should [buy headgear for its sound and build quality](https://old.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/ux2q5w/whats_the_current_situation_on_kzs_fake_driver/i9vewm4/) , not for how many drivers and how they're used. Although less drivers are simpler.


## Surround

### Headphones and Home Theater


### Surround headphones for Home Theater

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dayTAkq4L._AC_SL1312_.jpg" alt="Sennheiser RS 175" height="200"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6176ff9y2FL._AC_SL1279_.jpg" alt="Sony MDR-DS6500" height="240">


There's Products which take HDMI or TOSLINK then convert it to virtualized static surround for headphones in a home theater context like the [Sennheiser RS 175](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-RS-175-Wireless-Headphone/dp/B00SLUI5SA/) or the [Sony MDR-DS6500](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-DS6500-Wireless-Surround-Headphones/dp/B004P15HD0) . These would be limited to 5.1/7.1 and used specifically with their transmitter, and cost around $220.

### AVR

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GGZsQZQmL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Denon AVR-X1800H" height="240">

Apparently, most Dolby Atmos AVRs can virtualize DA to headphones based on a 5.1.2 decode. This would be the successor to Dolby Headphone [from the past](https://www.avforums.com/threads/av-receivers-with-dolby-headphone.1492235/) . Yamaha has its own processing called "silent cinema". For most AVRs, you would select the [virtual](https://manuals.denon.com/AVRS750H/NA/EN/DRDZSYyrtgycpw.php ) sound mode to enable headphone virtualization. Budget Dolby Atmos 5.1/7.1 AVRs cost around $350. Note that at this price, you can get a regular 5.1 AVR + speakers refurbished/renewed, so another option to consider.

## Head tracking 

### Beyerdynamic Headzone 

<img src="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images500x500/Beyerdynamic_498602_Headzone_Home_Surround_Sound_1233250620_580477.jpg" alt="Beyerdynamic Headzone Home" height="240">

The Beyerdynamic Headzone is a system that comes with a control box, and pair of semi-open DT880 headphones with a head tracker, so you can experience surround with a more stable and convincing placement due to the head tracking.

The [home version](https://www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-Headzone-Home-Surround-System/product-reviews/B001BADEN8/) has optical & Coax input for Consumer formats. There's also a [pro version](https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/beyerdynamic-headzone-pro) which has analogue connectors, and more config options. Someone noted the lag of head tracking. Note that this is a historical product and sold for about $3000, but documented for completeness to show what's possible.

The [Smyth Realizer](https://smyth-research.com/) can virtualize Dolby Atmos, DTS-X, and Auro. It comes with headtracking and you can customize the room sound. It has HDMI, Optical, and USB inputs, and can do 16ch analog output. But it's very expensive at around $4000.

### Modern Computer Systems

#### Hardware

In terms of head tracking gear, I guess the way to go for now, is the [supperware](https://supperware.co.uk/headtracker-overview) head tracker. It was $200, but now it's $100. It's supported by many software. You might be able to buy cheap or Legacy head trackers like Waves NX, but it's not particularly recommended as there is limited software compatibility, and support is diminishing. 

#### Software

If you're using head-tracking on a computer, your systems or software need to support head-tracking. There's various paid software which will accept surround, you will need to render your mix as surround, and it will be rotated & virtualized.

If you only have free software, then after rendering to surround, you may need to convert to Ambisonics, rotate it, then finally convert Ambisonics to binaural. The [IEM BinauralDecoder plugin](https://plugins.iem.at/docs/plugindescriptions/#binauraldecoder) is slightly unique in that it converts Ambisonics directly to binaural, without going through virtual speakers.

### Apple Devices


<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bhWgQK-cL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Airpods Pro" height="240">

Airpods Pro and Airpods 3 or later have the required sensors for head tracking. I don't own any recent Apple devices, so most of my information will be from other peoples' experiences.

The Airpods Pro are a bit bassy. There's not much of an angle difference between the side and back channels. The orientation resets after a few seconds of looking in a particular Direction. Nevertheless, it's a "cheap" and seamless way of experiencing head tracking if you have Apple devices. Airpods cost $170-200 or about $130 renewed and come with a charging case.

### Head tracking via phone body

Head tracking via phone body is an awkward and legacy concept that died off after the VR boom of 2015, but it's a viable option if you have limited/older hardware. Some functionality was [recently fixed](https://github.com/gkv311/sview/issues/115) in OpenAL for Android, so now you can experience it in Android with this build of sview. . Loading of custom IRs in the MHR format is [being discussed](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/issues/824) , along with [issues converting to MHR](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/issues/1028) . Thanks to 3DJ, kcat, and other contributors. Instructions to get working with default HRTF:

1. Download the build [from here](https://github.com/ThreeDeeJay/sview/releases/tag/latest)
2. HRTF must be forced ON in settings
3. File must have video or cover art
4. Set theatre view. Vertical orientation with your phone might work better
5. Pinch to zoom, and drag to rotate the view

You will get a maximum of 5.1/7.1 (whatever's decodable by FFMPEG)


## Surround headphones for PC

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71V7EV7lkzL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Logitech G635" height="240">
<img src="" alt="" height="240">

I'll briefly cover surround headphones for PC. Most surround headphones for PC are just stereo headphones, but the included driver software for Windows is a virtual 7.1 device, which virtualizes surround audio for the headphones. They typically cost from $50 - $250

There's also multi-driver headphones with several drivers in each ear cup for different speakers. I've tried 1 such product, and the difference from different directions wasn't particularly impressive.

So I would say that virtualizing approach is better, although you might as well buy regular stereo headphones and use software like [Hesuvi](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hesuvi/) (for MME apps) or Dolby Access (for MSS apps) to virtualize surround. 


## Neckband speakers

Neckband speakers are an alternative to speakers and headphones. There's hundreds of neckband speakers on Amazon, so I won't cover those. Instead, I'll cover surround products.

Techmoan reviewed on the [Sennheiser surrounder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ll-o4JttQk) from 1999. The surround works, but from a modern perspective, the wires and connections can be overwhelming.

#### Panasonic Neckband

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gHe34orTL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Panasonic SC-GN01" height="240">

The [Panasonic SC-GN01](https://shop.panasonic.com/products/soundslayer-wearable-gaming-speaker-system) , available for $200 apparently presents itself as a 4ch device to Windows for discrete surround input. It has a mic, and controls on the side. AFAIK these were the only 4.0 surround neckband speakers available to buy at the time.

The [Panasonic GNW10](https://na.panasonic.com/us/news/panasonic-introduces-new-soundslayertm-wearable-gaming-speaker-go-hard-your-game-not-your-ears) , available for $300 is an improved & wireless version. It might have more bass. For this version, Panasonic says "Real surround sound is available for PC only; for consoles virtual surround sound is used". Also, as with wireless devices, you're at the mercy of your batteries. 

#### Sony Neckband

Panasonic and Sony are fierce competitors in the consumer and professional markets, and Panasonic made their own neckband speakers. So Sony has also made a [SRS-N7 Neckband speaker](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/speakers/wearable-speakers/p/srsns7) which for the first time, supports Dolby Atmos for a home theatre rather than a PC context. But the speakers are closer together than the Panasonic unit, and I guessed it might be for virtualized surround.

Techmoan [Reviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUBeBUk5vxM) this in 2023. Surround features only work in conjunction with a Bravia XR TV, since the surround processing is probably done by the TV. So, the surround features didn't work for him. Also, he found them uncomfortable, so likely not a great unit in practice.
