## Introduction of Document
This document (as of now) will recount my movie experiences during my 2023 movies at the theater season, which includes [Fast X](#Fast-X) , [Mission Impossible 7](#mission-impossible-7), and [Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny](#indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny).

## Fast X

### Introduction

I haven't been to the cinema in many years due to the pandemic among other things, so this is my first time visiting in a while. Also, my first time for the visiting this venue. The cinema is one of only 3 multiplexes in my city which has DA theaters. The DA tier (about $18 USD) is more expensive than the cheap 51 tier. 

One thing I noticed is that I hardly saw any large black blobs on the screen due to Dust. The last time I went to the theatre was probably in 2011 with the Green Lantern which is probably one of the worst movies to watch. Back then, I noticed some large black blobs sometimes popping up. Not sure if that was a particularly small/Dusty theatre, or movie was near the end of its run, or the theatre used film (E: apparently this is around the time theaters started going digital).

### Pre-show
The Indiana Jones trailer played before the movie, but surround and Height activity was low. The DA trailer before the movie is unfold, which is probably the oldest. The ending bass rattled my chair. 

### Plot
The movie itself is mediocre, but the premise is simple and it makes sense more sense than F9. Dom killed Hernan Reyes in M5, and his son Dante wants revenge. Cipher (Charlize Theron) & choice make a return from M8, but it's Hernan Reyes's son, Dante, is dishing out the choices. There was also someone else that un-died in this film.

### Layout
Here are the estimated speaker locations for my theater 23.1.10

- Front/Screen (guess): L R C LFE1
- Left Side Wall: Lw1 Lw2 Lw3, Ls1 Ls2 Ls3 Ls4 
- Right Side Wall: Rw1 Rw Rw2, Rs1 Rs2 Rs3 Rs4 
- Back: Lrs1 Lrs2 Lrs3, Rrs1 Rrs2 Rrs3
- Top : Lts1 Lts2 Lts3 Lts4 Lts5, Rts1 Rts2 Rts3 Rts4 Rts5

I can't guarantee each speaker receives its own signal from the amp. There is prolly no CL & CR due to size of theater. There are no photos because my phone is bad at nightography. 

### Audio General
The dialogue is a bit boomy, but I guess that's to be expected of all Cinema settings. I'm hearing the speakers with my own ear, and so I don't get the usual coloration with HRTF on headphones. I sat in a few different seats during the movie and the dialogue seems to track vertically up & down as I moved rows, but I didn't check the dialogue staying center if I moved left or right. Wide speakers are present, but IDK if they're used.

### Audio Acoustics and directionality
The Cinema has about 30 speakers. I did hear the occasional thing from the back, but generally, it's hard to hear surround/height. Unless it's quiet, directionality is hard to hear, esp during loud action scenes since, your senses are overloaded, and most of the activity is carried at the front. (also, I confirmed with DDPA, this movie has low height activity, as does F9).

The sound diffuses everywhere since it's a large space with many speakers. So I think DA is better at home where you can lower the volume and hear Directionality better.

### Music
There's some good dynamic panning for the drums and the music. At some points I thought I could hear the piano at half height. And in Brazil (Bia - Furious) I thought I could hear the opening synths coming from 2/3 front height. I listened to the DA OST to check the height activity, but it turns out that the OST mix is different. In the movie, the lead synth pans L&R, but on the OST it's still. For the movie they likely had objects/stems. The soundtrack mix is a weird mix of upmixing & dynamic objects panned, but in a way that's sometimes only for show in the object viewer & hard to hear in practice.

I Also confirmed via DDPA that the opening synths in Bia - Furious (movie version) are only at ELL (Ear level layer), so being in theater, can give the illusion of sounds from the height layer, when they are not, due to speaker placement and acoustics.

### Conclusion
Being at a theater for the 1st time in some years has given me some much-needed insight into what happens with DA & movies in practice, and why. Barely using height & wides, is not a problem you can hear due to speaker placement & acoustics. This may explain poor surround/height activity for DA movies in general. Your ears could also be tricked into hearing phantom height, again due to speaker placement. A good home environment is better for experiencing DA, since you can control the volume & speaker placement to be more ideal, and thus dramatically improve directionality.

## Mission Impossible 7

![Mission Impossible 7 poster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/Mission-_Impossible_%E2%80%93_Dead_Reckoning_Part_One_poster.jpg)

### Experience
When I watched Fast X, a much lower-rated movie, there were about 12 people in the theatre including myself, on a weekday. When I watched Mission Impossible, which has very good ratings, on a weekend, the theatre was mostly full, so I'd say this is good attendance. You will definitely want to avoid sitting at the sides. I would also say the contingent was slightly older, but Fast X had a small sample size. A benefit of large audiences is that you can hear them laugh at the jokes, But the parts I found funny were a bit different to the audience. 

### Trailers
There was an ad for a local business, but I can hear the slap of double kicks. This may be due to upmixing the music, but I'm not sure if there's additional delay inserted, or due to the Acoustics of a large space. Trailer for killers of the flower moon. The music was upmixed, and I heard the music with its percussion mostly behind me.

### Plot

A new female character called Grace is introduced. But I like Illsa Faust better, since she is more composed & less panicky.

The premise this time, is Ethan's team need to retrieve two halves of a key that supposedly unlocks a chamber to an early version of "the entity". The movie also claims it has the source code. The public knows source code is important but most programmers should know, that source code is unlikely to exist in a non-web production environment, unless it's an interpreted language like python or Lua.

The entity is an AI that has penetrated many connected systems worldwide. On a cursory level, this might similar to Lawrence Kesteloot [Coding Machines](https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/coding-machines/) where an apparent compiler bug has spread so far.

The key changes hands quite a few times during the movie over some set pieces. At the end of the movie, there is some conclusion narrated by Kittridge, but it leaves the door open for part 2. I guess it was decided to shoot and release the movie in 2 parts. More movies, more munnies.

After the first Mission Impossible movies, they tend to run at a moderate pace, as if something is always happening or going to happen. This is in contrast to the first movie, where it feels more relaxed. Like when Ethan is talking to Max/Maxine. There's also more similarities to M1, there's an exchange taking place on a train involving Kittridge. And a fight scene atop a train. The fight scene atop the train looks slightly fake to me as there's some vague masking around the edges of the characters. The short scenes atop a train in Paddington Bear 2 look fake, but for different reasons. 

Recall in Fast and Furious 9, they apparently parodied the helicopter on the cliff edge from MI Fallout. This has seemingly come full circle when Ethan and Grace are running over a falling train similar to Brian running over a falling bus in Furious 7. In both Fast X & MI7 there were car chases in Rome.

There was a complaint that it was too long. Fair call it's about 8 minutes longer than Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. 

It's sort of predictable that things don't always go to plan, and Ethan's team have to improvise. Also, the usual Benji expecting Ethan to do something improbable.

The subject of MI7 is a bit topical since it's about a since the sub named Sevastopol, is also city in Russian-occupied Ukraine/Crimea (The Russo-Ukraine war of 2022 is still ongoing as of 2023). My personal complaint is that some characters look too similar to each other. Tina looks a bit like the white widow. But Grace looks even more like Illsa Faust, which also looks like Ethan's former wife.

In MI Fallout, the movie is about a nuclear bomb, so the title makes sense throughout the movie. Dead Reckoning refers to a navigation technique where you calculate your current position only by using a previous position and your speed and direction since. No landmarks or anything like that. At the beginning of MI7 there was a submarine navigating using dead reckoning with the Entity, but after that, there's nothing else relevant to the title. So for the second movie, I'd like something that makes good use of the title. 


## Score
The car chase scene through Rome was unscored. I also recall there was another car chase in Europe in a recent MI/Furious that was also unscored.

There are scores which do only the required things, match the picture & build the required tension. Then there are scores which are emotional or memorable, or are good music to listen to in their own right. The mission impossible score is just one of the former. Lorne Balfe (of Hans Zimmer's Remote Control productions) returned to score MI7, so comparisons to Inception & Batman are apparent when you hear the score, which Zimmer himself did score. " There's nothing here that sets it apart from dozens of scores produced by Hans Zimmer's Remote Control group" as Fred Meyers says on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Impossible-Fallout-Lorne-Balfe/product-reviews/B07DNTBKNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1) . You'll find more detailed discussions on [filmtracks]( https://www.filmtracks.com/titles/mission_imp6.html)

### Acoustics
There are manufacturing imperfections during speaker construction, and layering during sound design [was done](https://www.asoundeffect.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-sound/) , so from a theoretical POV, phasing could occur. But in the theater, I didn't hear much phasing. Not even speaker radiation/lobes effect. There was only a "smooth precedence effect" from the speakers as I walked around. During the way to the toilet, I tested the anchoring of dialogue to the center speaker by moving across the auditorium. And sure enough, center dialogue was always centered since it was in the center speaker. During the end credits, I was much closer to the screen, and there was a precedence effect the as music wanders to the nearest speaker. This is likely due to the screen speakers being flush as opposed to angled. [Trinnov Speaker Layout Guide p12](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qFpM5c9_n_0PU6EcW-J5qFvf4QDWqjg3/view)

### Panning
MI Rogue Nation had barely any height activity. Same for MI Fallout, except the ending helicopter chase sequence had good height. For MI DR1 , I thought there might be a bit of choir in the height channels (I was going off the previous movie), but I was wrong. I thought there might be some height activity when the train enters the tunnel (great surround panning there either way), and I was right for that part. But overall, there's not much height activity for MI Dead Reckoning. The [reverb acoustics](https://education.lenardaudio.com/en/17_cinema_6.html) and speaker placement of the cinema pushed the apparent soundfield upwards, so there is a phantom height effect.

### Loudness
Mission Impossible was pretty loud, as expected from the same venue. This is to be cautioned as "With Dolby Atmos every single channel is calibrated to 85 dBC. The Atmos peak demand is 115 dBC per loudspeaker. A system can have 64 speakers, or in other words the theoretical max SPL can be 133 dBC" 
https://www.grimmaudio.com/wp-content/uploads/cinema_loudness_aes_rome_2013.pdf

Sean Olive, past president of AES, commented [on twitter](https://twitter.com/seanolive/status/1688855498916048896) on Oppenheimer that it was "A good film but often quite loud hitting peaks over 110 dB".

### Conclusion
- Despite speaker manufacturing imperfections, and using layering during sound design (as said during the ASE interview)   on a likely 7.1 bed, I could not hear any phasing on the surround speaker array, only a "smooth precedence effect".
- Using the C channel for dialog ensures dialogue is anchored to the center, unlike score which is spread to L&R (as shown when I walk around the cinema)
- Cinema acoustics & speaker placement continue to push the soundfield upwards to make phantom height when it wasn't mixed that way  (as I was wrong about the height of some elements)


## Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny

![Indiana Jones 5 poster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny_theatrical_poster.jpg)

### Introduction

Apart from 1 Fast & Furious movie which I saw at the theaters in the 2000s, I didn't get introduced to some major movie franchises like Mission Impossible, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones until adulthood. they might have a movie marathon on TV of some movies to promote the new movie at the theatre, or whenever. So it wasn't until I saw Indiana Jones on TV that I got what the fuss was all about.  They're fun movies. Although the typical experience for watching movies on TV is that I miss the beginning of the movie since I don't know it's on. My local free-to-air channel did an Indiana Jones marathon sometime.

1. Raiders of the Lost Ark was good, although I missed a good chunk of the Beginnings and started watching from the bar raid went up in flames and the majority of the movie was about excavation in Egypt
2. The Temple of Doom  was too grotesque for me, the TV showed the banquet scene of them eating very strange animal body parts
3. The Last Crusade was okay, but I found the father son drama distracting. 
4. The Crystal Skull Was okay but weird
5. The Dial of Destiny is the first time, and probably the last that I will see Indiana Jones at the theatre

And although Indiana Jones was released before Mission Impossible, I saw it as the last movie of my 2023 movie season, due to prioritizing the DA format for MI7.

### Trailers
I was late to the movie so I didn't see a lot of ads/trailers, except for one. Due to the precedence effect, the balance was extremely sensitive, so left-right was unbalanced unless you're sitting in the middle three seats. There was also a reminder to turn off your mobile phone. The dialogue was unclear, perhaps due to being in stereo.

### Plot
The film opens with a train heist & fight sequence - get on the train, get something, then escape. Kind of like the ending sequence of Mission Impossible 7.

Indiana, Sallah, and Marion return for the sequel, and it's clear that they've aged. But Antonio Banderas and Karen Allen (AKA Marion) wished that they had more screen time.

In both recent Indiana Jones movies, relatives that Indiana doesn't know pop up and become his sidekick. Womble is a bit deceptive, a bit like Grace in Mission Impossible 7. The movie overall is a bit Mediocre. But if you watch an Indiana Jones movie, you get an Indiana Jones movie - he goes on an adventure & has fun. And at the end of the day, Indiana has got a certain Charisma about him that Dominic Toretto & the seemingly mindless action franchise lacks. The film ends slightly abruptly and anticlimactically.

I read the plot & themes on Wikipedia before seeing the movie. As they're about to enter Sicily, Indiana blurts out that Voller's coordinates are off due to continental drift. This seems a bit like a non-sequitur. Womble insisting Indiana return to the present to avoid changing the future isn't set out to be a big deal. Mangold (director) was trying to make a grey area in terms of "lack of clear good guys and bad guys", but IMO he hasn't succeeded since Voller's team often resorts to violence so it's really clear to the audience that Voller is a bad guy. The intention of replacing the Fuhrer & leading Germany to victory in WW2 doesn't really vindicate him.

Also, the usual great quotes from Indiana like "get back" and "A few times in my life I've seen things"

### Score
We have a score by John Williams, with lush strings. It's a welcome break from the overly-epic & tense MI scores (see above). Although the CD is seemingly hard to get, the score is available to stream online, and is also available in 7.1 on the BD.

### Experience
This was in older multiplex and the inside so it's a bit older with dark red highlights on the interior. I watched this movie likely with 5.1 audio. The downside of better sound (less loud) was a downgrade of the visual image. The contrast ratio is reduced - Blacks aren't quite black, they're just a dark grey. Perhaps due to environment or aging equipment.

The surround speakers are about 30* High, which is maybe a tad lower than the DA cinema. Although there are obviously no height speakers, you still get the sensation of planes flying over you if the sound is panned appropriately since every speaker is still above you. When I checked the DDPA, there is some height activity but perhaps not a lot since it's a Disney film. There's some height activity in the Battle of Syracuse.

### Audio Loudness
The overall level of the movie felt like 10-20dB quieter than the Dolby Atmos cinema. It's at an almost comfortable level. So I can hear Directionality better, even though the sound resolution is less. The manual for a Dolby Cinema audio processor, the increase from the default of Dolby 7 to Dolby 10 is 10dB.

With only 5.1, the sound field sounds a bit "dead" at times due to the precedence effect taking over (echoes in the cave), but the overall experience is reasonable. There are 3-4 speakers at each side and two at the back. 5.1 theaters are usually LCR at the front, then arrayed surrounds as the sides & back. To keep the precedence effect in check, you need to make sure there is a certain balance between the front and the back. This usually means the surround speakers should be 5dB or lower than front LR. When it's quiet, you won't hear individual surround speakers due to sharing audio over the whole array, but you hear them as a whole to produce an image. When they're loud, you might be able to hear them individually up close.
 
### Conclusion
5.1 is a decent experience. Lower volume = better directionality. Dialogue pans to the center will probably be clearer than panning to LR. The precedence effect takes over, so in surround, it's better to have the image slightly frontwards to achieve a comfortable & balanced image. Cinemas can vary in loudness. I enjoyed the score, at least it's not a Hans Zimmer copycat.
