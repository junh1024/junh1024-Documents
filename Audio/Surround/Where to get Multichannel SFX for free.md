## Surround
- [Noisemakers Template Project](https://www.noisemakers.fr/downloads/#1511818712704-826211b5-c698) 7.1 wind stem
- [4ch](https://freesound.org/search/?g=1&q=&f=%20channels:%224%22) , and [6ch](https://freesound.org/search/?g=1&q=&f=%20channels:%226%22) SFX on freesound.
- [Lucid Samples](https://www.lucidsamples.com/surround-samples/121-free-3d-sounds-surround-51.html) free pack in surround, they also sell other SFX up to 7.1, but I get the feeling they're decoded 1oA.

## VST
- [Noisemakers Pano](http://www.noisemakers.fr/product/pano/) (paid) 120E up to 8ch of generated SFX (although, judging from its size, it looks like it's actually a sampler)
- [AudioWeather Free](http://lesound.io/product-category/free/) A free weather synth, but sounds worse than above.

## Expired offers
- [Rick Hernandez Surround Recording](https://www.asoundeffect.com/surround-field-recording/#)
- [ProSoundEffects](https://shop.prosoundeffects.com/collections/ambisonics) used to have free samples, now they don't

## Still can't find mch FX? Be creative!
- Chop it in half time-wise, pan the 2 halves front/back. You'll lose directionality, but gain depth
- Reverb to back, this only works for ambience.
- Upmix to surround, again, this only works for ambience.
- [Free stereo SFX](https://articulatedsounds.com/audio-product/sfx/free-sound-effects)
- Nuendo might include a pack of free SFX
