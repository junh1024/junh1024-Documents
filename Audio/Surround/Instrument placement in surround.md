# Instrument placement in surround
## Center
#### Stars of the show
- Lead vocals
- Lead instrument for instrumental songs

## Front
#### Important Things
- Rhythm section (Drum Kit, Percussion, Bass)
- Lead instrument(s)
- Keys
- Guitars
- Woodwinds (Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon)

## Front & Back for 5.x/Front & Side for 7.x
#### Things With Long Notes
- Vocal Fills/Backups
- Strings (Usually All 4, Or Biased Front)
- Pads
- It is suggested to use my "2.0 to 5.0 Upmix V3 (L).txt" in [my suite](https://github.com/junh1024/Reaper-Surround#introduction) for spreading 2 to 4

## Back
#### Don't make it too distracting
- Brass
- E.Piano (but only if there isn't a A.piano)

## Height
#### Occasional Emphasis
- Front: High-pitched synths
- Side: Tubular bells, heavenly choirs
- All: Weather FX

## Notes
This is 1 arrangement for surround. Alternate arrangements can place Brass & Winds at the front, but leave strings spread to the sides.
