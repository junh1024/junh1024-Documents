# Instrument placement in surround

Where to place/pan instruments in surround.

## Center
#### Stars of the show
- Lead vocals
- Lead instrument for instrumental songs

## Front
#### Important Things
- Rhythm section (Drum Kit, Percussion, Bass)
- Lead instrument(s)
- Guitars
- Woodwinds (Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon)
- Percussive Synths & Pianos (if there's not enough activity @back, it's OK to put these @back. Remember to treat all pianos as a single group)

## Front & Back for 5.x/Front & Side for 7.x
#### Things With Long Notes
- Vocal Fills/Backups
- Strings (Usually All 4, Or Biased Front)
- Pads
- NEVER pan sounds directly to the sides for too long, it will sound bad & unstable, due to bad localization. It is recommended to use reverb or my "2.0 to 5.0 Upmix V3 (S).txt" in [my suite](https://github.com/junh1024/Reaper-Surround#introduction) for spreading 2 to 4 to decorrelate so it's more stable. My Surround guide V3 coming somewhen.

## Back
#### Don't make it too distracting
- Mostly back: Brass & Sax
- Very back: E.Piano (but only if there isn't a A.piano)

## Height
#### Occasional Emphasis
- Front: High-pitched synths
- Front partial height: Flute, Piccolo, Oboe
- Side: Tubular bells, heavenly choirs
- All: Weather FX
- It might be good to slightly reduce the height of height-panned items

## Notes
This is 1 arrangement for surround. Alternate arrangements can place Brass & Winds at the front, but leave strings spread to the sides.
