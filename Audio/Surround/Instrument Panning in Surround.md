# Instrument panning in surround

## Introduction

Where to place/pan instruments in surround. This is targeted towards a general/music context, but if you're mixing for a movie, it would be better to pan things front where I offer a choice.

## Front Center
#### Stars of the show
- Lead vocals
- Lead instrument for instrumental songs

## Front
#### Important Things
- All vocals (If you don't have separated lead/back vocals)
- Rhythm section (Drum Kit, Percussion, Bass)
- Lead instrument(s)
- Guitars
- Woodwinds (Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon)
- Percussive Synths

## Front OR Back
- Acoustic Piano (it should be front in most cases unless you know what you're doing) 
- Electric Piano
- It might be a good idea to put all pianos in the same place as they share some characteristics
- Brass & Sax
- May also be a good idea to put all Brass/Sax near each other, too

## Front AND Surround
#### Things With Long Notes
- Vocal Fills/Backups
- Strings
- Pads
- You SHOULD only spread these instruments to multiple pairs of speakers, ONLY if you use reverb, upmixers, or (object) size >30, since these approaches decorrelate the signal, so that it's more stable. They should also be biased slighly front to avoid balance issues. My Surround guide V3 coming somewhen.

## Height
#### Occasional Emphasis
- Front full height: High-pitched synths
- Front 1/2 height: Maybe some Auxuliary Percussion (or front, no height) 
- Front 1/5 height: Flute, Piccolo, Oboe (or front, no height)
- Front OR Side height: Tubular bells
- Front AND OR Side height: Choirs
- Half height: Weather Effects
- It might be good to slightly reduce the height of height-panned items
