# Key - Overview of Visual Novels

## Introduction

Key is a game developer, known for their emotional visual novels with good music. Key is under the "Visual Arts" parent company https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(company)#History , and is sometimes called "Visual Arts/Key". This document covers major game releases to 2023 by Key. Generally, I'll go through the premise, milestones for Key, reviews, and anime for each game. The document has spoilers for some games, although [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE77B46J/) claims spoilers don't ruin stories. 

As I've not played any of these games in any significant capacity (yet), I will present my curation of others' opinions rather than my own (apart from the review of the music in Keybox). Trial versions were used to check certain aspects. Please support Key by buying the Japanese version and then applying an English patch, or buying the official English version. Much information is from VNDB (including play times) and Wikipedia. I ~wasted~ spent a lot of time reading reviews and wrote most of it over a few weeks. No robots or AI LLM was used for writing the bulk of the text, but for checking a few statements due to lack of human interest in the document. Or maybe I am a robot :)

### What is a visual novel?

In contrast with many 3D games where you can freely explore a 3D World, visual novels are a class of games which generally have 2D art of the characters coupled with text to present the story. Usually, there are choices that you can make, which influences outcomes and endings. The player is usually expected to replay the game multiple times to experience different endings and plot in its entirety. Although the endings are different, the plot is often "coherent as a result of a sum of its parts". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(video_game) .

There many be multiple releases of games with different age ratings, and games may be re-released over time to improve graphics, sound, or features. Romance is ["deeply embedded"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSoafwp4Ig2hqG1n_vH2WP2QFMPeWD08fo4k-jfGceMmDDDRdFSbkAQyMpV_mbhFaIHuSmrOC69mWTi/pub) in most VNs, and many have adult scenes. Although with Key, they're usually not well integrated into the story, so you can probably play the all-ages version instead. 

As VNs are heavily text-based, many can automatically advance the text for you, or skim until the next choice. The text speed can usually be adjusted. Modern VNs may also let you [control the volume](https://youtu.be/Hbo9yO7bk0g&t=45) for major characters, in case you don't like their voice, or want to narrate yourself. Some games won't show you the separate volume control for a character, until you've seen them in-game. Now that's attention to detail!

Many VNs have a date display, which serves as a progress indicator within a particular route. Most VNs will have an intro movie set to music, which introduces the characters and the setting. For some VNs, heroines have their own leitmotif (theme music) and maybe associated ending themes. The music serves to heighten the emotional connection and impact.

Since there is slightly less effort involved to make this type of game compared to a free-roaming 3D game, it can be done on a reduced budget. There are many small game companies in Japan which make VNs, and there are many indie developers in the western world which make VNs for the Steam marketplace, for the better and the worse. [Nearly 70%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel) of PC games released in 2006 in Japan were visual novels.

Many VNs have a PC release, and some include platforms which were more successful in Japan, like Dreamcast and PS Vita. Although some VNs are Playstation-exclusives like [Kimikiss](https://vndb.org/v1187) . VNs for xbox are rare since the xbox wasn't so successful in Japan.

3D Games from major game studios may take [around 20h +- 50%](https://howlongtobeat.com/stats) to finish. There are VNs of that length, regarded as "medium" length by VNDB. The longest VNs may take about 80h to finish and have over 200 save slots.

### History of Key

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/Mizuka_One_game_screenshot.png)

*image: One, talking to Mizuka in a bedroom*

Before forming Key, the founding members worked on [One - Kagayaku Kisetsu e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One:_Kagayaku_Kisetsu_e) , a seminal VN that [blends romance & sci-fi](https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/one-for-nintendo-switch-pc-reveals-mayu-shiina-with-new-trailer-art) and ["aimed to be ToHeart but sadder"](https://steamcommunity.com/id/k7gendo/recommended/2432100/) . A [remake of One](https://vndb.org/v37118) suitable for a wider demographic [was released](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2432100/ONE/) in December 2023.

"Due to differing opinions between Nexton and most of the production staff in Tactics on how to produce the brand's next game, most of Tactics' staff left Nexton", and eventually formed Key in July 1998 a few months after they left - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(company)#History .

They quickly set to work on Kanon. ["Their upcoming release at that time was so heavily hyped"](https://web.archive.org/web/20060613182223/http://bluemist.animeblogger.net/archives/Key/) since people were keen to see what the team behind the acclaimed One would make. Kanon was finally released in 1999, and the rest is history. People have also been selling Doujin (indie) comics & music covers/remixes from Key games at Comiket and other events, since they love Key so much.

### What's so special about Key?

Key's emotional games follow a formula which was developed at Tactics. A comedic beginning, "a heart-warming romantic middle, ... a tragic separation, and finally ... an emotional reunion." This is known as a "nakige" or "crying game". "The main purpose of such a game is to make the player feel for the characters, and make them cry due to emotional scenarios, which serves to leave a bigger impact on the player after the game is over". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(company)#Impact .

The "Key formula" can be a powerful tool when done right, or it can be unimpressive and lacking immersion when done poorly. This could be analogous to Blake Snyder's ["Save the Cat"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Snyder#Save_the_Cat!) book for writing Hollywood Movies, which [has influenced](https://slate.com/culture/2013/07/hollywood-and-blake-snyders-screenwriting-book-save-the-cat.html) good & bad movies alike.

## 1st Decade

### Kanon

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Kanon_Ayu_screenshot.jpg)

*image: Kanon, talking to Ayu outside a building*

[Kanon](https://vndb.org/v33) is the first VN that was released under Key in 1999, and is set in winter. It follows the protagonist who is trying to regain his memories of a city from 7 years ago. There are five heroines. You'll bump into them soon enough - It's part of the story :) . A major theme in Kanon is making and honoring promises. It takes about 30 hours to complete the game. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanon_(video_game)#Setting_and_themes

The soundtrack is mostly light pop/electronic (typical of many VNs) , and The soundtrack is 1 CD. This OP is Last Regrets, and the ED is Kaze no Tadoritatsu Basho. The English rap in the ED is [unrelated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZCRxdbXQzo&lc=UgwBQGupTcIsOAXu5bZ4AaABAg) to the rest of the song since it was from a rap sample CD that was popular at the time. "The five heroines have leitmotifs" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanon_(video_game)#Music . 

Summarizing the [reviews on VNDB](https://vndb.org/v33/minireviews#review) , it shows its age & flaws, but it's still a pleasant experience, and many people found the atmosphere & soundtrack comfy. 

There is a 2002 anime of 12 episodes. In 2006, [there was a remake](https://anidb.net/anime/4404) with much improved quality done by KyoAni.

### Air

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Misuzu_original_Air_game.jpg)

*image: Air, talking to Misuzu outside a house*

[Air](https://vndb.org/v36/) is the 2nd game released under Key in 2000. It's set in summer, in contrast with the winter setting of Kanon. You assume the role of Yukito, a travelling puppeteer, and have been told to look for "the girl in the skies" since it's your destiny to save her, although for most part, her two feet stay firmly planted on the ground _CHECKTHIS. [VNDB/FREETYPE](https://vndb.org/v36) . The story [begins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cpspDf9_ks) as you're dropped off at a bus stop in a small, sleepy town.

There is a 3-part structure to the story. The game takes about 30h to complete, and the soundtrack spans 2 CDs. There are three major themes for Air. The OP is Tori no Uta, The ED is Farewell song, and the insert song is Aozora. Although "Tori no Uta best captures the themes of Air," it was a difficult process since he was [under pressure and inexperienced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tori_no_Uta) at the time. Some of Air's soundtrack is available as a [GBA ROM](http://web.archive.org/web/20080520101748/http://www.inside-cap.com/download/air_sound.htm) . Perhaps this was a testbed for their GBA version of Air.

The complex plot structure [confused some people](https://vndb.org/v36/minireviews#review), and ther heroines were deemed [too "moe"](https://vndb.org/w6622#review) for some, but was praised for its themes and plot. "... the Japanese public (in March 2001) felt Air to be a soothing game, but ... there was not one person who worked on Air who thought that." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(video_game)#Reception_and_sales

Although Air came after CLANNAD, Air is KyoAni's 1st animated work of Key, and it's slightly rushed since they compressed about 20 hours into 12 episodes _CHECKTHIS. The [12-episode anime](https://anidb.net/anime/2002) aired in 2005.

### CLANNAD

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fb/Nagisa_Furukawa_Key_screenshot.png)

*image: Talking to Nagisa on the Sakura-lined path on the way to school*

The story of [CLANNAD](https://vndb.org/v4) is set during high school. You assume the role of Tomoya the delinquent, but Nagisa and others start to befriend you. Slowly, life begins to change, but life isn't without its troubles. The first part of the game focuses on high school life. The second part called "After Story" focuses on the next 7 years in life. The day-to-day interactions, plot, and romance make up the bulk of CLANNAD, and are its main appeal.

CLANNAD was released in 2004, so it would [competing](https://web.archive.org/web/20060613182223/http://bluemist.animeblogger.net/archives/Key/) against Fate Stay Night. It marks multiple milestones for Key. It would be Key's 1st game targeting all ages, (which would broaden its appeal), and Key's 1st game to be about 80h long. It has a lot of routes, and its long length will certainly leave an impression.

The soundtrack spans 3 CDs. There is the use of synthesizer pads in the soundtrack to add a sense of atmosphere. CLANNAD has 1 OP (Megumeru), 2 EDs, and 1 insert song. Most heroines have their own leitmotifs. CLANNAD has an anime, broadcast in 2 seasons, over 2007-2009. The OP for S1 is a remix of Megumeru, and the ED is Dango Daikazoku, a remix of Nagisa's leitmotif. The OP for S2 is Toki wo Kizamu Uta, a remix of Onaji Takami he, and the ED is Torch, an original composition.

[Most reviews](https://vndb.org/v4/minireviews#review) of CLANNAD were positive. kusomisoenjoyer had the opinion that you [could skip the game](https://old.reddit.com/r/vns/comments/stcmmz/whats_the_best_Key_visual_novel/hx5sgcs/) since the game is a bit dated and complex, and the anime was so good. Ewig_Custos remarked there were [some things that were better](https://old.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/2v5i9z/spoilers_weekly_thread_36_clannad/coet1w0/) in the VN, but they "expected to see some character growth from Tomoya, not Tomoyo dropping all ambitions for him".

After the success of CLANNAD, Key released a sequel focusing on Tomoyo called "Tomoyo After - It's a Wonderful Life," but the opinion of reviewers [was mixed](https://vndb.org/v12/minireviews#review) . The soundtrack of Tomoyo after follows a more relaxed pace then CLANNAD, and is mostly piano and guitar based.

Like many people, I was first introduced to Key via the [CLANNAD anime](https://anidb.net/anime/5101) . I have fond memories of watching this on my newly-built computer in roughly 2010. The anime did a good job in linearizing the story and compressing content coverage from about 60h to 48+2 episodes over 2 seasons. The main focus is Nagisa, but you have story arcs which feature bits from other characters' routes. A minor complaint I have from watching the anime, is that although Tomoya and Tomoyo have very different Kanji, their names sound very similar when pronounced.

CLANNAD is [available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/324160/CLANNAD/)

Kanon, Air, and CLANNAD form the core 3 franchises of Key.

### CLANNAD HD technical analysis

- There are problems with the 5.1 soundtrack. Please **[see my analysis](https://github.com/junh1024/junh1024-Documents/blob/master/Games/Key%20-%20Various%20Reviews.md#introduction)** .

### Planetarian

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Planetarian_screenshot.jpg)

*image: Talking to Yumemi in the Planetarium*

[Planetarian](https://vndb.org/v34) is set in a post-apocalyptic world where you're roped in to fix a planetarium projector by a cute girl (but actually a robot). She's called Yumemi Hoshino. Her name couldn't be [more fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetarian:_The_Reverie_of_a_Little_Planet#Characters) - it could "be interpreted as dreaming of a planet... Yumemi is the only character shown to the" player.

Planetarian is a 1st and a departure in the philosophy of Key games in that it's a "kinetic novel" with a completely linear gameplay and no choices. It's very short at 6 hours to finish. Planetarian is also the 1st game to have a trial version.

Planetarian was [mostly praised](https://vndb.org/v34/minireviews#review) by reviewers as having an emotional impact despite its short length. There is a anime, but it has a slightly [different nuance](https://vndb.org/w7746#threadstart) to the game.

### Little Busters

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/Little_Busters%21_game_cover.jpg)
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Komari_Kamikita_Key_screenshot.jpg)

*image: Little Busters cover art and talking to Komari on the rooftop*

[Little Busters](https://vndb.org/v5) was released in 2007. It follows a group of kids that take you in after your parents died, called Little Busters. Gradually, your sadness disappeared. Now in High School, you still hang out and play with them. At 80 hours, it's also another big game. Whereas CLANNAD focuses on romance, Little Busters' 1ry focus is on friendship (although there is still a decent amount of romance). [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1jucrd/clannad_or_little_busters_and_if_both_in_what/) . A Baseball mini-game is part of the gameplay.

Art exhibitions [were held](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Busters!#Marketing) to promote Little Busters, which included [flowcharts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Busters!#cite_note-25) for CLANNAD and Little Busters.

Little Busters Perfect Edition was released in 2012, which included "a Rin Natsume-themed system sounds package for Windows". Throwplate remarks that it was [common practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwCZvIm1nXc&lc=Ugw0CcWU70LxdewW7oh4AaABAg) in the "mid-2000s (for) visual novels, doujin games, and anime drama CDs" to include system sounds to customize your PC.

Little Busters set a milestone in that it's the 1st game by Key to be mostly voiced for the initial release on PC. Little Busters also marks a change in the music - there is a turn towards rock as a genre (which I'm not so keen on) and use of electric guitars for theme songs. But luckily, the soundtrack is still light pop.

[Most reviews](https://vndb.org/v5/minireviews#review) were positive, but a few were mediocre. Summarizing the reviews, it's probably Key's best game, better than CLANNAD (by a small margin). The true route is amazing, but the individual routes are still decent (depending on your taste). The male characters are well defined and add to the overall experience. The (comedic) day-to-day interactions or "slice of life", is executed as well as CLANNAD. Although, replaying the routes might be tedious.

The Little Busters didn't get an anime for quite some time. And when it did get one, it wasn't going to be animated by KyoAni, since they were [busy at the time](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=425425) with [Chuunibyou](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?goto=post&topicid=1935365&id=63686329). Many people were disappointed by this, since KyoAni is known for its quality adaptations of Key games. It got animated by JC staff in 2013 and it turned out quite mediocre. The Refrain anime was a bit better.

Little Busters is [available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/635940/Little_Busters_English_Edition)

## 2nd Decade

### Angel Beats

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Angel_Beats%21_DVD_Complete_Collection_cover.jpg)

*image: Angel Beats DVD cover*

In 2010, [Angel Beats](https://anidb.net/anime/6564) the anime was released. This is the 1st anime original project for Key, but is animated by PA Works instead of KyoAni. This is also the first time action is involved. In some ways, it's similar to Little Busters. They're both set in imaginary worlds, since the real world was not so kind. After living a satisfactory life, they try to get back to the real world _CHECKTHIS. My [Anime recommendations](https://github.com/junh1024/junh1024-Documents/blob/master/Anime/Anime%20Recommendations.md#action) document does a good introduction to the anime. The soundtrack is 2 CDs. There is a rock band that plays in the anime and those have their own CDs. The game soundtrack is mostly the same as the anime soundtrack, with the addition of a few new songs.

[Angel Beats 1st Beat](https://vndb.org/v13774) the game was released in 2015. Further games in the franchise have seemingly been abandoned.

[Ryu was impressed](https://vndb.org/w3103#review) that seemingly "inconsequential" choices had some impact on the story, and they had fun trying out all the choices. Elements from the anime are expanded on, especially the characters of Iwasawa and Matsushita. "The game covers episodes 1 to 10 of the anime", so the story is obviously cut short at some points. "Despite it only being the first part of a bigger VN that never was, it still functions as a complement to the anime... ". 

It's unfortunate that there are no further installments to the Angel Beats games. [Ryab said](https://vndb.org/t20805.6) "Maeda ... was done writing VNs after Little Busters. He ... helped write the overall idea's for the character routes in the Angel Beats VN. Other writes at Key would basically turn them into VN routes from his overall ideas. He actually wrote these though for every character that was going to be included in all 6 volumes.

It is assumed really the only thing stopping production of the later volumes is Maeda not wanting his work to be shown to the public. He has a lot of self confidence issues after all of the (criticism) that he received with his last 2 anime series. (Charlotte & Kamisama, see below)"

### Rewrite

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/Rewrite_game_cover.jpg)
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Rewrite_screenshot.jpg)

*image: Rewrite cover art and Talking to Kotori in the classroom*

Key's next game is called [Rewrite](https://anidb.net/anime/6564), which was released in 2011. This is perhaps the Key work that has the most different setting - it's set in a forest city, and has a very grand scale of events. "The story follows the life of Kotarou... who investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school... This ultimately leads him into the middle of a conflict between... (two major powers) with the fate of the world at stake." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_(video_game) . Although there is comedy & romance as with previous Key VNs, the main focus later on in the game is the supernatural and mysteries https://manga.fandom.com/wiki/Rewrite_(visual_novel) . Well, if you're still investigating mysteries of the world, maybe it would make sense if the whole cast was teleported into the world a few years prior :) .

Anyway, Compared to other games where the protagonist has a bland & lacking features, the protagonist has [a bit more personality](https://vndb.org/t11562.9) & presence in Rewrite. Rewrite is also the 1st major game that Jun Maeda wasn't a writer for the scenario. At about 80 hours to finish, and it's probably Key's most ambitious work due to several factors.

Rewrite is also the 1st game to be released in a 16:9 widescreen AR instead of 4:3, and uses the new Siglus engine. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_(video_game)#Development . Apart from a trial version, a free benchmark program called "Chihaya Rolling" [is available](http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/rewrite/download.html) on the original Rewrite website to test how well a user's PC can run the new Siglus engine. 

- **Please also see [my satirical review of Chihaya Rolling](https://github.com/junh1024/junh1024-Documents/blob/master/Games/Key%20-%20Various%20Reviews.md#chihaya-rolling)**

Rewrite has a top-notch voice cast with the likes of Chiwa Saitou, Eri Kitamura, and Kana Hanazawa. One thing I noiticed is that Akane sounds like Chiwa Saitou, but Chiwa is [listed as voicing Kotori](http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/rewrite/cha_kotori.html) instead. The voice cast information [is correct](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4s0vqt/spoilers_rewrite_episode_2_discussion/d55uma3/) , it's just that Chiwa Saitou has "a really impressive range of voices."

So you typically in anime, you have pairs of characters are flat-chested but short-tempered, and well-endowed but timid. Examples include Sakurako & Himawari from Yuru Yuri, Akebono & Ushio from Kancolle, and Minko & Nako in Hanasaku Iroha. But with Rewrite, it's reversed. Shizuru is the the timid one, while Lucia is well-endowed but the one to dish out insults. Which goes to show that Rewrite isn't completely adhering to tropes. We might also have breaking the 4th wall during comedy sections, but I'd say that's typical.

The game soundtrack spans 3 CDs, and the anime soundtrack spans 4 CDs. There is the use of woodwinds and (pizzicato) strings to represent nature in the soundtrack. The heroines [have leitmotifs](https://rewrite.fandom.com/wiki/Rewrite_Original_Soundtrack#Leitmotifs) , and at least some of the leitmotifs have vocal arrangements as Ending songs, or songs on related albums. There are 5 ending songs. Watari no Uta and CANOE are the ending themes for the Moon and Terra routes respectively. The melody is the same, but the lyrics and arrangement is different. I'd say Rewrite probably has the best soundtrack of modern key games, and Air out of classic key games. Rewrite has enough quantity, variety, emotion, and vocal songs.
The Rewrite OST is [available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1856580/Rewrite_Original_Soundtrack/)

"When Key was developing... Rewrite (2011), music director Shinji Orito was" [looking for someone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owari_no_Hoshi_no_Love_Song) to sing 2 theme songs he composed. "Orito's friend Manyo introduced Yanagi to him, who agreed to collaborate with Key on Rewrite". Yanagi Nagi [would later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagi_Yanagi#2012%E2%80%932016:_Solo_debut) do her solo debut single with "Vidro Moyou", the ending to the "Ano Natsu" anime, and her solo debut album Euaru, released in 2013. Go listen to both of them, they're good.

Summarizing the [reviews on VNDB](https://vndb.org/v751/minireviews#review), although it's not Key's best work due to noticeable flaws, you'll still be blown away, especially if it's your 1st VN. Zany25 [felt the common route was](https://vndb.org/w5652#threadstart) "literally the best common route I've ever had in a Key VN", although (parts of) Rewrite aren't appealing for everyone due to reasons like writing & theming, and some felt there could be more visuals in a few places.

Although in Rewrite+ (a revision of the original) more routes are [initially unlocked](https://github.com/sekaiproject/game-bug-reports/discussions/2#discussioncomment-1930047), it's still advisable to play the routes as per the original release. That is, Kotori, Chihaya, Lucia, then Shizuru, Akane, Moon, and Terra. The latter ("serves as the true conclusion to the story") . Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_(video_game)#Gameplay . 

The official English version of Rewrite+ is [on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680000/Rewrite/) , however, [osk notes](https://steamcommunity.com/id/osk__/recommended/1680000/) that although it's a good game, the handling of the official English release is not as good as it could've been. Also, the ending was simplified "too much" as per Rewrite+.

A sequel to Rewrite called [Rewrite Harvest Festa}(https://vndb.org/v8020) was released in 2012.  It's about 15 hours to complete.

The Rewrite anime is not so great. The anime adapts the common route https://rewrite.fandom.com/wiki/Rewrite_(TV_Anime) , [focusing on Lucia](https://anidb.net/anime/11643) , then diverges from the game to a [anime-original route](https://rewrite.fandom.com/wiki/Anime-Original_Route) starting from S1 ep 8. S2 [combines Moon and Terra](https://rewrite.fandom.com/wiki/Rewrite_2nd_Season) , with a focus on Kagari. S1 compressed maybe 30h of the game into into 12 episodes _CHECKTHIS . As a result, it's incredibly rushed, and there are many plot holes. It's very mediocre and the 2 mini-reviews on [AnidB](https://anidb.net/anime/11643) suggest it's for fans only. The [2nd season](https://anidb.net/anime/12429) is rated slightly better than the first season, but still mediocre.

### Further Anime

![](https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/g/gin1261/20200113/20200113200849.jpg)

*image: Charlotte "blue" poster*

Key also produced some anime during the period of 2015-2018, also animated by PA Works.

[**Charlotte**](https://anidb.net/anime/10997) aired in 2016. But no-one is called Charlotte, just like no one is called Akira in that movie. Yuu joins a school of people with special abilities by deceit, but Nao has seen through his ruse. While investigating these abilities, they get into more trouble that they ever imagined. (Rewritten again, from [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28999) ). Like Angel Beats , there is somehow a rock band and there are CD releases of those. There are 13 episodes and the average rating is 7.08 on AniDB.

Summarizing the [recommendations](https://anidb.net/anime/10997) AKA mini-reviews, there are 2 halves to the anime (typical to Key anime), you might not like the 2nd half, but "If you liked Angel Beats, I guess you should give it a try." 

**The Day I Became a God**. "Narukami Youta is a high schooler who planned to spend his last summer vacation ... preparing for his university entrance exams. But when a young girl named Hina approaches him saying she's a god, his summer vacation suddenly becomes anything but ordinary."

[sammy321 writes](https://anidb.net/anime/15559) "The premise of someone claiming to be a god was interesting. This series is broken into 2 halves. The 1st half is silly comedy and was a blast to watch; however the 2nd half takes a turn and gets serious and gloomy; ... Unfortunately, the two different tones did not mesh well together and there are lots of plot holes in the 2nd half of the series."

### Harmonia

Harmonia is Key's 2nd Kinetic Novel, and was released in 2016. Like Planetarian, it's also set in a post-apocalyptic world sometime in the future, but also inhabited by androids due to the decline of humans.

Harmonia takes about 6 hours to complete. It still has some emotional impact, but obviously not as much as a longer VNs - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonia_(video_game)

## 3rd Decade

### Key Box - "For two decades" review

- It's not that great. Please **[see my review](https://github.com/junh1024/junh1024-Documents/blob/master/Games/Key%20-%20Various%20Reviews.md#key-box---for-two-decades-review)** .

### Summer Pockets

In 2018, Key released Summer Pockets. This is set "on a fictional island on the Seto Inland Sea". The protagonist has come to the island following the recent death of his grandmother, and "gets to know the townsfolk of Torishirojima and multiple girls who are the focus of the story". It takes about 60h to finish. Reflection Blue was released in 2020, with more routes and heroines. 

Jun Maeda wrote the concept for Summer Pockets, but shortly afterwards he was hospitalized, so other writers were bought in to write the script. Summer Pockets returns to a more traditional romance-based game for Key. 

Many reviews were positive. The [setting and atmosphere](https://old.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/rod7va/weekly_discussion_387_summer_pockets/hpxs22u) were highlights and the shortened common route was an improvement from Rewrite. But there were also critical opinions, like from Omegoa & BAmario. The writing felt forced & constrained. It's [heavily reminiscent to previous games](https://old.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/13lz9q9/summer_pockets_review/) , but misses the emotional nuances that made them [genuine and believable](https://vndb.org/w3083#threadstart) , and there were places which felt like you were [obviously being directed](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Summer-Pockets-REFLECTION-BLUE-Switch/product-reviews/B0916N4GH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1) to laugh or cry. The routes [lacked cohesion](https://old.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/rod7va/weekly_discussion_387_summer_pockets/hpxs22u/) in themes, and the heavy reliance on the supernatural felt more like convenience than an enhancement. [People that haven't played previous Key games](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Summer-Pockets-Switch/product-reviews/B07PBY6SZ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1#) would enjoy it more. 

As of 2023, Key is trying to get an anime adaptation produced.

### Further Kinetic Novels

The [coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) took hold of the world starting from February 2020, and is still ongoing as of Dec 2023 with a small 5th wave. "The pandemic caused severe social and economic disruption around the world," and jobs/income were affected as a result. Perhaps it's with this context that 
"Key announced the development of three kinetic novels in October 2020", which were released from 2021-2022. These Kinetic Novels take 6-10 hours each to finish, and are priced accordingly.

Some reviewers had [critical opinions](https://vndb.org/v29445/minireviews#review) on [Loopers](https://vndb.org/v29445) due to the writing. But for [Stella of The End](https://vndb.org/v29443) and [Lunaria](https://vndb.org/v29444) , the opinion was mostly positive and the latter [was praised](https://vndb.org/w3392#review) as being "quite immersive" and "almost cinematic" and due to the special effects and fast presentation of graphics. As expected of a game about virtual worlds, a noticeable portion of the soundtrack is electronic, but there's also other parts in piano.

### Heaven Burns Red

In 2021, with the rise of mobile gaming and shrinking consumer purchasing power due to pandemic effects & rising food prices, Key jumped on the mobile gacha bandwagon and released [Heaven Burns Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Burns_Red). A steady stream of income from microtransactions is better for business, rather than surges around product releases. On the plus side, HBR is natively available for PC.

The scenario is that the Earth is being attacked by alien lifeforms, and conventional weapons have no effect. But humanity has developed the Seraph - the only things effective against them. But somehow, only girls can wield the Seraph. Well, let's just accept it and move along.

Jun Maeda returned as writer, and continues his collaboration with singer Yanagi Nagi. Several digital singles were released. Similar to some current mobile games like Fate Grand Order, players fight with a team of characters, and there are story interludes like a VN. The [VNDB says](https://vndb.org/v33924/lengthvotes) about 110 hours to finish up to chapter 4. Note this game is JP-only.

## Conclusion

If you've finished most of the Key VNs and you want something large in scope & length, you can try [Aiyoku no Eustia](https://vndb.org/v3770). Or if you want to more traditional romance, you can try [ToHeart 2](https://vndb.org/v20/). Again, I haven't played any of these.

New content in Heaven Burns Red is likely to continue for at least another 1-2 years. Future VNs of medium length and good plot from Key are possible, but uncertain. Would this be Anemoi? More game installments in the Angel Beats franchise would be nice. Cheers to Key's 27th year.
