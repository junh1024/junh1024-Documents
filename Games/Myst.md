# Myst

My experience with the Myst franchise

I played Myst III as a kid, hired from the library. I restarted the game several times because I thought that if you were fast enough you could open the elevator and catch the bad guy. I spent a long time wandering around the cliffs and the gardens, and not making much progress. I had to use a walkthrough to make any decent progress. Most walkthroughs mention saving before the Voltiac rollercoaster cuz riding it looks cool. [This speedrunner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW5yvBEwLcc) finished the entire game in 12.5 minutes, putting me to shame.

I've also played Realmyst 1. I was able to access the hidden room in the library, and that's about it. Myst 2 wasn't able to run on any of my computers cuz they're too new. I didn't play Myst 4 much, it was a spacehog on my PC. I was almost able to complete the ice level in Myst 5 with slightly less dependence on a walkthrough. In Uru, I was not able to get past the desert stage.
