# EV Nova Guide

## Introduction

EV Nova is a space adventure game, released in 2002 for Mac OS classic & X, and 2003 for windows. There are a few small differences, prolly bugs, but otherwise almost the same. Most of the story is told through text. It was developed by Ambrosia Software, founded in 1993 and defunct in 2017. It's a bit astonishing that a indie software company lasted 25 years. Although it's the third game in the Escape Velocity series, it features a different story/universe. Returning players from EV/EVO will notice the many graphical & gameplay/QoL improvements. See [Appendix I] for a comprehensive list.

There are 6 major govenments in the game you can "join", and some factions within each. The Federation has become corrupt with its power but they cover a large portion of the map (roughly anagulous to "the Empire" in Star Wars), and so a simplification could be everyone else vs the Federation. The game also allows plugins to be installed. They can modify the game to add new ships, outfits, missions, to completely replacing the game scenario. This guide is slightly spoilerific to cover some pitfalls & nasties that you may experience so you can avoid them. This guide will cover several objectives:

- Decent money
- Decent ship
- Hypergate access
- Without using cheats/plugins or 3rd-pty profiles

## Experience

The game, in terms of a modern experience, hasn't aged well. You will need 3rd-pty hacks to get widescreen, and works better at lower resolutions since HiDPI wasn't really a thing in 2002, unless you have a big monitor. If you have an unregistered copy, many things are limited. Outfits, ships, boarding actions, storyline progress, modifying game files, and loading plugins. And a overpowered ship that shoots you down after the trial period. But Ambrosia Software is now defunct so you can't pay for it. It is highly suggested you somehow coax the game into thinking your game is registered otherwise your experience will be very bad. 

## Mechanics

- Different ships are different sizes & attributes, which influences their handling and weapon/cargo capacity.
- You can add outfits such as weapons & upgrades
- Travel to different star systems by doing a hyperjump (which costs fuel)
- You can get fuel with credits, or outfits
- To get a good ship, you need credits
- You can get credits by doing missions, trading, or mining.
	- You can do passenger, cargo, or (rush) UN shipping missions.
	- Trade commodities like food, medical, metal, etc. Buy low & sell high.
	- I have found mining to be tedious & unprofitable, and there's a risk of making ships mad at you should your mining laser accidentally hit them. But there's a mining guide.
- Unlock better outfits & ships by allying with a government and completing their storyline
- To start a storyline, you probably need a combat record
- To get a combat record, you need to destroy ships
- But if you destroy arbitrary ships you will prolly get hated by a government
- If you get hated, ships of that government may attempt to destroy you & may forbid you from landing, unless you pay a bribe
- Carrying contraband or illicit outfits will not get you hated by a government, but will make patrol boats attack you
- You can hire escorts to fight or freight
- You can board ships when they're disabled to get their booty, or attempt to use them as escorts/your own
- The game auto-saves to your pilot file when you take off. It's advised to make regular pilot backups.
- If you are killed, just reload your pilot to revive them (unless you have strict play)
- If you manage to escape via escape pod when your ship is destroyed, your record with governments will be cleared, but also your combat rating


## Shortcuts

Shortcuts are vital to playing the game. Make sure you memorize most of what's in the keyboard preferences so you can quickly react when things go awry. There are also keys to activate services when you land so you can like, trade quicker. You can mostly have 2-3 dialogs onscreen simultaneously, so you can check your profile while you trade. Some shortcuts that aren't mentioned in the prefs:
- Shift-click to plan a route on the map
- Alt-click but in the trade center to buy the max amount
- Alt-Y to communicate w/ a planet while you have a ship selected
- 1-4 to select different planets in the system


## Sense
- These things still make no sense in the game (EV Nova 1.0.10 w32). I don't think you can make plugins to fix all of this.
- The mission debriefings talk about payment into your account as if it was an entity that's not on your ship. However, when pirates board your ship, they can steal your credits as if your credits were on your ship.
- If you have Solar panels, no matter how sunny as day is or how long you spend unloading cargo on a planet, they will only recharge in space.
- If you bribe a planet to let you land and then target another ship, the planet will forget you paid, but money has already been deducted from your account.

## Guide

To get hypergate access (and many storylines), you will need to have a combat record. Destroying arbitrary ships will prolly get you hated. You can destroy pirate ships (they tend to disable & loot), but you may get hated by pirates. But Harbor in Scheall is hostile by default. You can destroy Houseless Aurorans near/in Kipa. But although they don't have a legal rating, they can still deny you landing clearance.

You can kill Marauders instead. Marauders are also hated by all, but they don't have a planet. They tend to destroy rather than loot. In Wolf 359, a Marauders has a 10% chance of appearing. In Tichel, it's 20%, but it's also likely there are big fed botes that can take your kill.

I initially dismissed trading is not a very good way of making money because there are ships in the game that you get the impression of having traded their entire lives but they never have more than anything than a heavy shuttle. But you can do much better than this in just a few hours.

## Trading

- Buy Luxury goods on Europa (Sol), and sell them on Earth
- Medical supplies  on Earth (Sol) >  Equipment on Port Kane (Kania) > Luxury goods on Europa (Sol), modified Barry route

Those 2 are some trade routes I have used. You start out with a Shuttle, but you can hire Cargo Drone(s) when you feel comfortable. Used escorts can be cheaper. Move on to Terrapins, IDA Frigates, then Pegasi as you accumulate credits. A Leviathan is not suggested since "they hold 4x as much cargo as a Pegasus, but cost 6x as much" (EVula Survival Guide). Terrapins are terrible if you're driving them yourself because it's so frustrating to land 1. But not if it's being driven by the CPU. Keep in mind that you need some credits in reserve because you will need to pay your escorts daily. Otherwise they will defect and you will lose your cargo. When you get 10-20M cr, it's time to buy a ship and start a storyline.


Now, you will be well on your way to starting a major storyline of the game.





## Ship

Taken from Sapphire's [Ship Guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/562562-escape-velocity-nova/faqs/23469) , Many ship configurations fall into 1 of 2 categories:
1. Small & Fast Pocket Rocket, or
2. Big & slow battlestation

Small ships in general can't take many hits, but they're not annoying to land & manoeuver. Larger ships can take more hits & maybe better for close combat, but are less manoeuverable. The only ships that seem to buck this trend (aka big but fast) are Vell-os or Polaris ships. They might also be inertialess. Inertialess ships take a bit of getting use to, but they're very easy to land since you don't need to turn to reverse, just brake.

Most Auroran & Fed ships are a bit boring since you see them so often. Vell-os ships are cool, fast-turning & powerful weapons. I used to drive a Pirate Enterprise/Manticore maybe with cheat plugs to make them go faster, but such a ship isn't really my style anymore. I don't like Polaris ships since they're dark & have highlighter coloring. I used to drive a Krestrel in EV (prolly obtained & modded using cheat plugs), but there are more appealing ships in this game. Rebel ships look cool with their green coloring.


## Equipment
Rimshot glitechnia
Tichel - Viking
Koria & Evelei
Archenar-Sirrusa
Rautherion - Rauther

You should try to get new & legal versions of equipment. New equipment won't degrade, and legal equipment will pass scans. You have the money.


## Outfits

I drive a Starbridge cuz you can load up on weapons to do decent damage, but still fast enough to make a quick escape (except from the smallest fighters). My preferred style is long-range combat cuz you stay out of the way of dangerous close-range weapons like the ion cannon & th.head lance, and the Starbridge can take a few, but not too many hits. I acknowledge that the Hellhound/Gravimetric missiles pack quite a punch, but I prefer weapons with unlimited ammmo cuz it's annoying to remember to replenish your ammo after a battle. So my guide will focus on such a setup. I will also focus on weapons that you can buy without any storyline. For a more comprehensive guide on weapons, see JoshTigerheart's [EVN Close Combat Guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/562562-escape-velocity-nova/faqs/37758) . If you have any rare/special outfits that may come w/your ship, it's suggested to not sell them, since they might have unexpected benefits & you might not be able to buy them afterwards.


### Offensive





If you have a small ship, buy the non-turret versions since they're cheaper & lighter. For larger ships, buy the turret versions since you can't turn fast enough. I prefer not to buy projectiles since you need to spend time refilling them. I choose these weapons since they work at medium-long range, so you don't get damaged at close range. 
- 2 Fusion Pulse Cannon
- 1 100mm Fixed Railgun
- 1 150mm Fixed Railgun

### Defensive
- 2 Matrix Steel, 3t ea: EVN wiki says 1 of these is better than 3x Carbon Fiber, so I put it on. Available from proper Auroran outfitters.
- 2 Carbon Fiber, 1t ea. To make use of the space left over.
- Price & mass of these scale up with ship size so best for smaller ships.

### Sensor
1 Gravimetric Sensors: Makes the blobs on your radar bigger. I don't like the IFF sensor since while friendly ships are green & brighter, hostile ships are red and darker = harder to see.
1 Pirate Jammer: Supposedly the best jammer around, and you don't need to go to Scheall to buy it. Viking has it. I just hope it works.
Vectored Thrust
Horizontal Booster

### Fuel
2 Solar Panels: 3t ea. You should definitely get a fuel replenisher after you get a new ship, lest you get stuck in an uninhabited system. 1 panel would take too long to charge. A fission reactor would be better for larger ships. The sweet spot might be a Thorium reactor 8t, but you can only get that if you're in the Federation storyline.
1 Auto-recharger: also a must-have, saves you from pressing refuel on inhabited planets.

1 Afterburner: a must-have for any ship, a speed boost to zip away from projectiles & hostile ships during critical times. 
1 Port & Polish

### Licenses

1 Heavy Weapons License, 1 Missile Weapons License, 1 Protective Technologies License: You need licenses to buy some things. If you're getting a Exotic Ships and Weapons License for the polaron/ion cannon, get the legal version. There is a fake forged version which doesn't work & strips your other licenses & a lot of money.

### Upgrades

1 Sigma Electrical Rewiring, 1 Sigma Mount Reinforcement, 2 Sigma Mass Addition: The sigma upgrades while expensive, are one of the only ways to upgrade certain aspects of your ship post purchase. I prefer the ones which don't change handling.



## Combat

**Flee & fight back aka "Monty Python Maneuver"**

If you have a small ship, you can't take many projectile hits, so it's wise to flee & wait till their missiles, rockets, etc run out. Then you can turn around & fight back from long range, while they run into your fire.

**Draw away, then land aka "Not the Nine O'clock News Maneuver"**

Mostly for landing on blockaded planets. Fly away from the planet, then in an arc, then fly back towards the planet. Hopefully there'll be less firing.

Most of the time I have caps lock on to speed up the game. But you can turn it off in times of need, like combat and landing in hostile areas.

**Escorts**

Cargo drones are very cheap. Although they can only take 1 hit, you can use them as 'meat shields'. Or hire something more substantial with a gun like a shuttle or a few valkyries to defend you, possibly used. They will be defending you. Doesn't matter if they die, you live.If you care about daily expenses, you can use wormholes & hypergates to save on fees.

## Story

If you're ever in federation space a you're being chased by federation ships but don't think you've done anything wrong , it's time to head to auroran space. This really confused me the first time i encountered this situation.

If you have a mission to land on a hostile planet, they will waive the bribe and let you land anyway. But you generally can't choose the locations of missions, unless it's the Sigma deliveries. Those always end on Earth.

Your record with the Federation should be cleared after most storylines so don't worry too much if systems turn hostile for a while. Nonetheless, it may be helpful to kill a few baddies near Earth before/during/after the story to raise your rating. 


### Probe

If you keep on entering Fed bars, you may eventually encounter some nervous scientists approaching you. You need to ferry their space probe to the Kontik system in return for good money. You will notice the Kontik system is very far away. You can jump there, or use wormholes.  Head towards Kontik and drop off the probe.

### Drop Bears

Drop Bears are an annoying quirk and will continue to annoy you after you finish the Fed, Rebel, or Pirate storylines. If you're in the Auroran storyline, they won't target you, and if you have T2 capabilities (in the Vell-os or Polaris storylines), you can fend them off. The general consequence of an attack is a few % credits stolen and 14 days lost. Don't buy the repellent, it may increase the consequences/attacks, though there are plugs that can make this less annoying.

### Sigma

Completing The sigma missions allow you to buy their ships, outfits, and hypergate access. You will need a combat record of "Fair Ability" to get the final hypergate mission, or "Little Ability" to start the storyline. There may be delays of 30+ days between major missions. They start at the shipyard on Earth. Note that the final mission drops your legal rating with the Federation. If it was 0, then Earth will deny you landing & many systems will hate you, so it may help to raise your rating a bit so that you're not that hated after the final mission (but still not completely scot-free).


### Polaris

- Again, it may help to have a good rating with the Federation during the early stages of the Polaris storyline since your rating will drop soon.
- Finding Mu'ar Haro is one mission when a red arrow won't show the destination. In Polaris space, keep on buying maps at outfitters. It's deep in Polaris space.
- The Polaris storyline has 2 branches, the A branch (which will give you the cloeaking organ only & possibly make the wriath hostile), and the B branch (which will give you the multi-jump organ too). This is chosen rather early, so make a backup if your pilot before you land on Mu'ar Haro in case you get the bad branch. Avoided with the AllGoodBranches plugin.

### Wild Geese
- "During an early Wild Geese mission, you'll get into a fight with a bunch of thugs. He won't die with this plug in place... At the end of the Wild Geese storyline, you'll have to take a peace proposal to the pirate leader McGowan." Also solvable, from the  AllGoodBranches plugin.

## Appendix

## Changes

If you've planed the previous EV or EVO games, you'll notice some changes.

### General
- A slideshow to introduce you to the universe, instead of scrolling text & percussion. Barry has a few tutorial missions for you.
- New universe, though there are a few familiar names like Spica, and Sol is still the center
- New ships & outfits, notably, a lot more civilian & cargo ships. Ships are quite detailed, they don't look like toys.
- Systems are more unevenly spaced, which makes the map more interesting. About 4x more systems, and a greater fraction uninhabited, for a total of about 400 systems.
- There is a bit more activity/conflict around core regions, like Sol. Sol is no longer the quiet haven it was in EV.

### Gameplay
- Rebels are more idealistic & righteous, but less of a material presence in the galaxy (kinda like [Star Wars](),). They have only 2 systems. The pirates are reduced to 1, but there are a lot of pirate ships wandering about in other systems. Rebels aren't red, but are green this time. Red is the color of the Aurorans.
- You can't buy a fake ID to make the Federation govt like you again. You have to earn it the hard way. But most storylines will reset your record with them after completion.
- You don't need to travel all the way to the pirate base to buy pirate outfits. Many are sold 1 jump away from Sol.
- NPC ships now know how to land quickly, without swinging around like crazy prior
- You can upgrade your escorts, and assign different orders to different types
- The universe is centered on several human races
- Starting a storyline is perhaps easier
- Corporations now play a larger part of the game and missions can now appear anywhere, like the shipyard (for the Sigma storyline).
- Planets can & will shoot
- Hypergates & Wormholes are a thing, you can traverse them to get same-day, no-fuel travel.

### Graphics
- Ships are faux-3D, but they behave very much like 2D as before. This has a side effect of making addons harder. You need to have a 3D model and rotate it in 3D. You can't just have a 2D top-down image & spin it, otherwise it won't fit in with the built-in ships, unless you replaced them all.
- Ships can have running lights and ship animations when cruising &/turning. Planets can also be animated
- You can use the cursor to select objects, and a mini map how appears when you select your jump destination while cruising. Very handy.
- More graphics options for weapons to make your beam prettier
- New layout for main spaceport, and a more detailed UI overall. Different government ships have their own HUD graphics
 
### Internals
- A windows port, which doesn't use resource forks. There's some esoteric differences like l33t text not working & the CATS leviathan losing his paintjon after capture
- An expressive control bit system which can add/remove ranks, outfits, ships, and random branching
- NPC ships only turn hostile, if they incur damage from you. Non-damage weapons such as tractor beams would previously anger CPU ships.
- You won't encounter an invisible wall at the edge of a system. Instead, you will wrap to the opposite edge. So you can actually run away from pursuers now.
