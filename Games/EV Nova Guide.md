## Introduction

EV Nova is a space adventure game, released in 2002 for Mac OS classic & X, and 2003 for windows. There are a few small esoteric differences, like l33t text seemingly not working & appearance of colored ships in the Windows version, but otherwise almost the same. Most of the story is told through text. It was developed by Ambrosia Software, founded in 1993 and defunct in 2017. It's a bit astonishing that a indie software company lasted 25 years. Although it's the third game in the Escape Velocity series, it features a different story/universe. There are 6 major govenments in the game you can "join", and factions within each that may be in support or opposition of their body. The Federation has become corrupt with its power but they cover a large portion of the map (roughly anagulous to "the Empire" in Star Wars), and so a simplification could be everyone else vs the Federation. This guide is slightly spoilerific to cover some pitfalls & nasties that you may experience so you can avoid them. This guide will cover several objectives:

- decent money
- decent ship
- hypergate access
- without using cheats/plugins or 3rd-pty profiles

## Changes

If you've planed the previous EV or EVO games, you'll notice some changes.

### General
- A slideshow to introduce you to the universe, instead of scrolling text & percussion. Barry has a few tutorial missions for you.
- New universe, though there are a few familiar names like Spica, and Sol is still the center
- New ships & outfits, notably, a lot more civilian & cargo ships. Ships are quite detailed, they don't look like toys.
- Systems are more unevenly spaced, which makes the map more interesting. About 4x more systems, and a greater fraction uninhabited, for a total of about 400 systems.

### Gameplay
- Rebels are more idealistic & righteous, but less of a material presence in the galaxy (kinda like [Star Wars](),). They have only 2 systems. The pirates are reduced to 1, but there are a lot of pirate ships wandering about in other systems. Rebels aren't red, but are green this time. Red is the color of the Aurorans.
- You can't buy a fake ID to make the Federation govt like you again. You have to earn it the hard way. But most storylines will reset your record with them after completion.
- You don't need to travel all the way to the pirate base to buy pirate outfits. Many are sold 1 jump away from Sol.
- NPC ships now know how to land quickly, without swinging around like crazy prior
- You can upgrade your escorts, and assign different orders to different types
- The universe is centered on several human races
- Starting a storyline is perhaps easier
- Corporations now play a larger part of the game and missions can now appear anywhere, like the shipyard (for the Sigma storyline).
- Planets can & will shoot
- Hypergates & Wormholes are a thing, you can traverse them to get same-day, no-fuel travel.

### Graphics
- Ships are faux-3D, but they behave very much like 2D as before. This has a side effect of making addons harder. You need to have a 3D model and rotate it in 3D. You can't just have a 2D top-down image & spin it, otherwise it won't fit in with the built-in ships, unless you replaced them all.
- Ships can have running lights and ship animations when cruising &/turning. Planets can also be animated
- You can use the cursor to select objects, and a mini map how appears when you select your jump destination while cruising. Very handy.
- More graphics options for weapons to make your beam prettier
- New layout for main spaceport, and a more detailed UI overall. Different government ships have their own HUD graphics
 
### Internals
- A windows port, which doesn't use resource forks
- An expressive control bit system which can add/remove ranks, outfits, ships, and random branching
- NPC ships only turn hostile, if they incur damage from you. Non-damage weapons such as tractor beams would previously anger CPU ships.
- You won't encounter an invisible wall at the edge of a system. Instead, you will wrap to the opposite edge. So you can actually run away from pursuers now.

 
## Sense
- These things still make no sense in the game (EV Nova 1.0.10 w32). I don't think you can make plugins to fix this.
- The mission debriefings talk about payment into your account as if it was an entity that's not on your ship. However, when pirates board your ship, they can steal your credits as if your credits were on your ship.
- If you have Solar panels, no matter how sunny as day is or how long you spend unloading cargo on a planet, they will only recharge in space.
- If you bribe a planet to let you land and then target another ship, the planet will forget you paid, but money has already been deducted from your account.

## Experience

The game, in terms of a modern experience, hasn't aged well. You will need 3rd-pty hacks to get widescreen, and works better at lower resolutions since things don't scale, unless you have a big monitor. If you have an unregistered copy, many things are limited. Outfits, ships, boarding actions, storyline progress, modifying game files, and loading plugins. And a overpowered ship that shoots you down after the trial period. But Ambrosia Software is now defunct so you can't pay for it. It is highly suggested you somehow coax the game into thinking your game is registered otherwise your experience will be very bad.

## Mechanics

- To get a good ship, you need money
- You can get money by doing missions, trading, or mining.
	- You can do passenger, cargo, or (rush) UN shipping missions.
	- Trade commodities like food, medical, metal, etc. Buy low & sell high.
	- I have found mining to be tedious & unprofitable. But there's a mining guide.
- Unlock better outfits & ships by allying with a government and completing their storyline
- To start a storyline, you probably need a combat record
- To get a combat record, you need to destroy ships
- But if you destroy arbitrary ships you will prolly get hated by a government
- If you get hated, ships of that government may attempt to destroy you & may forbid you from landing, unless you pay a bribe
- You can hire escorts to fight or freight
- You can board ships when they're disabled to get their booty, or attempt to use them as escorts/your own
- The game auto-saves when you take off

## Guide

To get hypergate access (and many storylines), you will need to have a combat record. Destroying arbitrary ships will prolly get you hated. You can destroy pirate ships (they tend to disable & loot), but you may get hated by pirates. But Harbor in Scheall is hostile by default. You can destroy Houseless Aurorans near/in Kipa. But although they don't have a legal rating, they can still deny you landing clearance.

You can kill Marauders instead. Marauders are also hated by all, but they don't have a planet. They tend to destroy rather than loot. In Wolf 359, a Marauders has a 10% chance of appearing. In Tichel, it's 20%, but it's also likely there are big fed botes that can take your kill.

I initially dismissed trading is not a very good way of making money because there are ships in the game that you get the impression of heavily traded their entire lives but they never have more than anything than a heavy shuttle. But you can do much better than this.


## Equipment
Rimshot glitechnia
Tichel - Viking
Koria & Evelei
Archenar-Sirrusa
Rautherion - Rauther

You should try to get new & legal versions of equipment. New equipment won't degrade, and legal equipment will pass scans. You have the money.

## Combat

**Flee & fight back aka "Monty Python Maneuver"**

If you have a small ship, you can't take many projectile hits, so it's wise to flee & wait till their missiles, rockets, etc run out. Then you can turn around & fight back from long range, while they run into your fire.

**Draw away, then land aka "Not the Nine O'clock News Maneuver"**

Mostly for landing on blockaded planets. Fly away from the planet, then in an arc, then fly back towards the planet. Hopefully there'll be less firing.

Most of the time I have caps lock on to speed up the game. But you can turn it off in times of need, like combat and landing in hostile areas.

**Escorts**

Cargo drones are very cheap. Although they can only take 1 hit, you can use them as 'meat shields'. Or hire something more substantial with a gun like a shuttle or a few valkyries to defend you, possibly used.  They will be defending you. Doesn't matter if they die, you live.If you care about daily expenses, you can use wormholes & hypergates to save on fees.

## Ship

Taken from Sapphire's [Ship Guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/562562-escape-velocity-nova/faqs/23469) , Many ship configurations fall into 1 of 2 categories:
1. Small & Fast Pocket Rocket, or
2. Big & slow battlestation

Small ships in general can't take many hits, but they're not annoying to land & manoeuver. Larger ships can take more hits & maybe better for close combat, but are less manoeuverable. The only ships that seem to buck this trend (aka big but fast) are Vell-os or Polaris ships. They might also be inertialess. Inertialess ships take a bit of getting use to, but they're very easy to land since you don't need to turn to reverse, just brake.



## Shortcuts

Shortcuts are vital to playing the game. Make sure you memorize most of what's in the keyboard preferences so you can quickly react when things go awry. There are also keys to activate services when you land so you can like, trade quicker. You can mostly have 2-3 dialogs onscreen simultaneously, so you can check your profile while you trade. Some shortcuts that aren't mentioned in the prefs:
- Shift-click to plan a route on the map
- Alt-click but in the trade center to buy the max amount
- Alt-Y to communicate w/ a planet while you have a ship selected
- 1-4 to select different planets in the system

## Outfits

I drive a Starbridge cuz you can load up on weapons to do decent damage, but still fast enough to make a quick escape (except from the smallest fighters). My preferred style is long-range combat cuz you stay out of the way of dangerous close-range weapons like the ion cannon & th.head lance, and the Starbridge can take a few, but not too many hits. I acknowledge that the Hellhound/Gravimetric missiles pack quite a punch, but I prefer weapons with unlimited ammmo cuz it's annoying to remember to replenish your ammo after a battle. So my guide will focus on such a setup. I will also focus on weapons that you can buy without any storyline. For a more comprehensive guide on weapons, see JoshTigerheart's [EVN Close Combat Guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/562562-escape-velocity-nova/faqs/37758) . If you have any rare/special outfits that may come w/your ship, it's suggested to not sell them, since they might have unexpected benefits & you might not be able to buy them afterwards.


### Offensive





If you have a small ship, buy the non-turret versions since they're cheaper & lighter. For larger ships, buy the turret versions since you can't turn fast enough. I prefer not to buy projectiles since you need to spend time refilling them. I choose these weapons since they work at medium-long range, so you don't get damaged at close range. 
- 2 Fusion Pulse Cannon
- 1 100mm Fixed Railgun
- 1 150mm Fixed Railgun

### Defensive
- 2 Matrix Steel, 3t ea: EVN wiki says 1 of these is better than 3x Carbon Fiber, so I put it on. Available from proper Auroran outfitters.
- 2 Carbon Fiber, 1t ea. To make use of the space left over.
- Price & mass of these scale up with ship size so best for smaller ships.

### Sensor
1 Gravimetric Sensors: Makes the blobs on your radar bigger. I don't like the IFF sensor since while friendly ships are green & brighter, hostile ships are red and darker = harder to see.
1 Pirate Jammer: Supposedly the best jammer around, and you don't need to go to Scheall to buy it. Viking has it. I just hope it works.
Vectored Thrust
Horizontal Booster

### Fuel
2 Solar Panels: 3t ea. You should definitely get a fuel replenisher after you get a new ship, lest you get stuck in an uninhabited system. 1 panel would take too long to charge. A fission reactor would be better for larger ships. The sweet spot might be a Thorium reactor 8t, but you can only get that if you're in the Federation storyline.
1 Auto-recharger: also a  must-have, saves you from pressing refuel on inhabited planets.

1 Afterburner: a must-have for any ship, a speed boost to zip away from projectiles & hostile ships during critical times. 
1 Port & Polish

### Licenses

1 Heavy Weapons License, 1 Missile Weapons License, 1 Protective Technologies License. You need licenses to buy some things. But there is an 

### Upgrades

1 Sigma Electrical Rewiring, 1 Sigma Mount Reinforcement, 2 Sigma Mass Addition.

## Trading

- Luxury goods on Europa (Sol) ? Earth (Sol)
- Equipment on Port Kane (Kania) ? Luxury goods on Europa (Sol) ? Medical supplies on Earth (Sol) ? Port Kane (Kania)* 

Buy medical supplies on earth and sell them at X on the X system. Then buy X at the X system and sell them at europa in the sol system. Repeat the steps until you have enough money to hire a terrapin at the bar. Hire the cheapest 1. Terrapins are terrible if you driving them yourself because it's so frustrating to land 1. But not if it's being driven by the cpu. Then you can buy and sell a larger amount of goods at once. Repeat this until you have a fleet of terrapin and a few million credits. Keep in mind that you need some credits in reserve because you will need to pay your escorts daily. Otherwise they will defect and you will lose your cargo.

Now you will have enough money to buy the best ship you can without completing any storylines. The star bridge. Remember on any new ship that you bye, always buy a auto recharger and as many solar panels as you can. You don't want to be stuck without fuel and having to wait ages to hail a friendly ship. You keep on entering bars, you may eventually encounter some nervous scientist approaching you. You need to siri there space probe to the Kontik system in return for good money. You will notice the Kontik system is very far away.

We will attempt to kill 3 birds with one stone, explore more of the universe, get a combat record, complete this mission. In the far east of the solar system there is a wormhole. Wormholes link to other wormholes, but you can't choose a specific destination. But they take less than a day to traverse, like hypergates. Keep on landing on wormholes until you reach near the Kontik system. At this point you will be in a system occupied by houseless aurorans. No one cares if you destroyer ship. So destroy a ship and jump out of the system. Head towards Kontik and drop off the probe. Head back to earth, hang around, and hopefully you'll be offered the opportunity to get hypergate access.

Now, you will be well on your way to starting a major storyline of the game. If you're ever in federation space a you're being chased by federation ships but don't think you've done anything wrong , it's time to head to aurora aurora in space. This really confused me the first time i encountered this situation.
