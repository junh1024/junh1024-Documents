# EV Nova for KC players

## Introduction

Kantai Collection/kancolle is a web-based naval management game which launched in 2013. It has personified ships from WW2 navies (mainly IJN ships), defending against alien ships. KC is a F2P game. You can play for free, but things get a bit easier if you pay for items & upgrades. The devs also make money from merchandise/licenses. EV Nova is a space adventure game, available in 2003 for Mac & windows. It's now impossibru to buy EVN legally since the publisher went defunct, but the [remake of the previous game](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosmicfrontier/cosmic-frontier-override) by a related staff is slated for 2021. They both have ships. Apart from that, they're completely different games.

If you play KC and want something refreshing & simple, you can try EVN, although I suspect the reason you play KC is for cute grils. Or the historical connection, they put decent effort into historically-inspired personalities & quirks. If you play EVN, I don't really suggest playing the timesink that's KC. It's quite complex with many game mechanics and as of 2020 needs a VPN &/ proxy to play, and translated guides as the game is in JP. But if you're drawn by the cute grils, historical WW2 connection, and enjoy a challenge, I'm not stopping you. Welcome all.

I don't play KC and I haven't finished all 6 storylines of EVN, so this is a best-effort from me. This is not a comprehensive guide to play either game, it covers mainly fundamental differences. For more info, please consult the wiki [tutorial](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Tutorial:_How_to_Play), or my EVN guide. This document will use [some abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_classification_symbol) , mostly CV=carrier & DD=destroyer.

## Content
As KC is a server-based game, new content such as ships & maps are mainly available through quarterly time-limited events. This promotes timely participation. EVN is an offline game, and you can expand or replace the game scenario with plugins. As the EV series has mac baggage dating back to 1995, you will need to DL windows-specific plugins, or use a [converter](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/andrews05/evstuff/master/utilities/Plug-in_Extractor.zip) to use them on windows. http://www.cytheraguides.com/archives/ambrosia_addons/evn/ has many. Tho I'm not aware of any plugin that adds WW2-style ships.

## Fleet

![fleet composition](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/8/87/Composition_Menu.png)

In KC, you can have up to 6 ships in your active fleet (Pokemon seems to have set a precedent in 1996), and sometimes a 2nd fleet for events for a total of 6 ships. Ships might carry planes, and if they're a dedicated CV, they sorta don't fight otherwise. Formation choice is an important aspect to balance attack/defense, depending on the enemy type & formation. You don't want to get red T.

Fleet composition is an important part of KC , so that you can select the right types of ships with the right abilities that you have, to fight the enemy efficiently. In many cases, you might have 2 capital ships & 4 smaller ships for a battle. And very often you have type restrictions dictated by the map. In rare cases, you can have a janky setup of sth like BB, CVL, CL, 3x DD, to clear an "easy" map (where was the lounge comment of someone having a janky setup?).

Specific ship & ordering is also important. A ship in the 1st (flagship) or 6th position usually incurs them less damage. Setting a particular flagship may influence what ships can be built. Like setting some German ships as secretary, so that you can build a Bismarck. Also, in order to possibly activate the powerful [Nagatouch](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Nagato#Special_Mechanics) attack, you need to set her as flagship, have another BB as 2nd ship, and a few other requirements. Sometimes it doesn't activate when you need it the most, like in [events](https://old.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/ix0sls/discussion_rainysummer_event_survey_evaluation/). 

Setting a particular ship as secretary is also done for cosmetic purposes. Like seeing them on your home screen & hearing their voice lines. The VAs are females, and speak mostly Japanese (including the foreign ships). Many VAs voice multiple ships, cuz there's >200 ships, and about 50 VAs in the game. There could be more VAs to potentially make the ships more unique in voice, but it's more convenient to reuse VAs, and there might not be that many appropriate VAs to fill the role of kanmusu.

In EVN, you drive 1 ship, and have up to 5 escorts (captured or hired). Your escorts may be CVs, so they can launch more ships. Ships can have bays (including yours), and each bay can have 1-4 fighters. CVs implies decent guns. Formation choice and ordering isn't really a thing in EVN, but you can choose commands for your fleet from: formation, attack, defend, hold position. By carefully using these, you can draw fire towards your escort & freeing yourself, or vice versa to better suit your objective. There are voice hails in EVN, which change depending on what ship(s) you have as your escorts. Thare are some Pirate hails which have some yarr in them, and some Wild Geese hails which have some British accent. These play only if you issue a command to your escort(s). Again, due to #VAs (3?) vs # voice hail groups (7?) VAs are reused like KC.

Fleet composition in EVN isn't really as picky as KC. If you want to freight, pick a freight ship, if you want to fight, pick a big ship with lots of shields (small escorts aren't particularly useful & will prolly get fried very quickly, unless you want to use them as meat shields). Auroran Cruiser as an escort is great for long-range combat since it has the railguns, only problem is capturing it. Only limit is your credit if you're paying for your escorts. It is usually not worthwhile to pick a specific ship to do missions that require them.

## Resources
In KC, you have 4 major [resources](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Resources) : Fuel, Steel, Ammo, Bauxite. And some minor ones like buckets, medals, blueprints, screws for certain processes. As KC is a server-client game, it saves frequently & the state is stored on the server. Doing battles and repair will consume the major resources. Repairs for large ships can take a few hours, so you can use the instant repair buckets to speed up the process. Although you regenerate major resources over time, you prolly want more by doing expeditions & quests. There is a soft cap for resources from regeneration, which can be exceeded by your manual efforts. Resources have a hard cap which is the maximum you can hoard. Your ships will not repair themselves during battle, and sinking is usually permanent.

[Expeditions](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Expeditions) are the main way of getting resources in KC. They can take from minuites to days. There are specific composition and maybe minimum stats to meet in order to have a successfull expedition & get resources. If you don't meet the minimum requirements, the expedition will fail & you won't get the resources, but some resources will be consumed. You will still get some, but reduced experience.

In EVN, you have credits & fuel. There are major commodities (like food, metal, etc) and minor commodities you can trade between places, but the end result is credits which you can use to buy things. You get a Rank (late) into the progression of your storyline. Most Ranks offera small daily pay &/ friendly discounts on relevant planets but is prolly not enough for anything significant.

Ship shields recharge during battle, and is restored when you land.  The game auto-saves when you take off, so if your ship is destroyed & you die in space, just reload your pilot file. If you have strict play enabled, you need an escape pod to live after your ship is destroyed.

Like KC, Fuel is used when you travel between map nodes (aka hyperjump). Also used some (powerful) weapons, and certain outfits. Fuel can be purchased or generated with some outfits. Projectiles have separate launchers & ammo. You need to buy specific ammo to replenish your launcher. There is no "refuel & replenish" button like in KC.


## Music
KC has music in a few genres. During events, there is new music for battles, which has been praised as one of the high points of events. You can also change the music in the office with the [Jukebox](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Furniture/Jukebox) function. In EVN, apart from the OP, there is no music, which is a weak point. But it does have some ambience for some planets.


## Customization

![]()
![]()

![Furniture Shop menu](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/2/25/Furniture_shop.png)	![Ion cannon](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/5/50/Nova_pict_6020.png)

KC has [ample](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Furniture) ability to customize the office using Furniture coins which are [available](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Furniture/Guide) from regular missions. Some furniture overrides the Jukebox, or has seasonal CGs. In addition, some ships have seasonal art, like Summer & Christmas CGs. Guns are mostly grey during battle and planes are mostly green.

EVN doesn't really have such a thing. You can change your pilot name, you set a nickname at the start, and set a ship name when you buy a ship. There are plugins that can apply a paint tint to your ship, but I had trouble getting rid of my paintjob with the Paintshop HGA plugin & prolly screwed my pilot file. Different families of weapons have different colors. This is a slight benefit over KC. See appendix for details.

## Missions

Missions are the heart of EVN. Like KC, there is a order & prerequisite for some missions, mainly the storyline ones. Some missions are offered as you land, some at the bar, and some through mission BBS. If you decline or abort missions, you usually don't get another chance (unless you made a copy of your pilot file, or use plugins). There are repeating generic passenger/cargo missions sorta like the daily quests, but neither pay much.

## Equipment
Like ships, you generally can't get a specific piece of equipment at will, you need to build equipment. Or farm ships for specific equipment, for whatever desireable [Isuzu](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1896340) & [Shimakaze](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1680914) have, but apparently it's not done anymore?

In EVN, you just buy equipment, but you don't have access to everything. You need to play the storyline to unlock more outfits and gain the trust of a government.

KC has a restrictive slot-based system for equipment. Each ships comes with some slots, and only certain equipment can be fitted to those slots. Like, you can't put a plane on a DD, and you can't put a Daihatsu on a BB. You can maybe unlock more slots by remodelling the ship. There are also [incentives](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Gun_Fit_Bonuses) to fit guns of the right size on your ship, and penalties if you don't.

You can choose equipment to add on your ships, but be careful not to worsen your overall fleet. Cuz installing AA equipment on more ships [can](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Anti-Air_Fire#Anti-Air_Cut-In) make your AA attacks worse due to ships with worse AA stealing the attack from ships with better AA. In reality tho, almost all IJN ships weren't designed to have their engines or guns swapped, it's just another gameplay element. Except for perhaps the [Mogami-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogami-class_cruiser) .

EVN has a more flexible system for outfits. You can generally fit what you want as long as you have enough weapons space, although certain limits apply. Some items have a purchase limit. If your ship doesn't have enough mount points for guns, you can slightly increase it with Mount Reinforcement. If you want more weapons space, you can exchange cargo space for weapons space, and vice versa. The closest thing to a Fit bonus are hidden ship speed modifications. Most reactors will give you a small speed boost, while some guns will make your ship handle slightly slower. But these detriments are mostly offset by commonly available upgrades.

Some outfits need licenses, so you can buy the cover-all "Exotic Ships & Weapons License". But some outfits are available illegal form, w/o the license or storyline requirement. Or in a cheap version. And some items are always illegal (to the Feds), like EMP torpedoes or some fighter Bays for some reaspon. The consequence of having an illegal/cheap item is an attack by a Federation patrol boat if you get scanned (Which is a bit annoying), and your equipment imploding in the case of cheap items. So try to buy new & legal if you can.

![12.7cm Gun](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/c/cb/Equipment297-1.png)	![Medium Blaster](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/9/9e/Nova_pict_6001.png)

Let's have a look at the [Fubuki gun](https://en.kancollewiki.net/12.7cm_Twin_Gun_Mount_Type_A) and the Medium Blaster (above). They're very mediocre & you prolly want something better. In KC, you want the [Duck Gun](https://en.kancollewiki.net/10cm_Twin_High-angle_Mount_%2B_Anti-Aircraft_Fire_Director) and the [Oxygen Torpedo launcher](https://en.kancollewiki.net/61cm_Quad_(Oxygen)_Torpedo_Mount) for a DD. And in EVN, you want a ~~certain magical~~ [150mm Railgun](https://evn.fandom.com/wiki/100mm_Railgun) for safe, long-range combat and theif you want projectiles.


[Standard ~~exploding dildo~~ torpedo](https://en.kancollewiki.net/61cm_Triple_Torpedo_Mount) is cheap shit [IR]()/[radar]() missiles. Don't use them since every (competent) man & his dog has a jammer for those, *especially* [Pirates](https://evn.fandom.com/wiki/Pirate_Jammer). You want the [Oxygen torpedo](https://en.kancollewiki.net/61cm_Triple_\(Oxygen\)_Torpedo_Mount) in KC and the  [Hellhound Missile](https://evn.fandom.com/wiki/Hellhound_Missile_Launcher) /  in EVN. The Hellhound does splash damage & ionization so if you don't want that use the [Gravimetric Missile]() . There are a few projectiles that are maybe more devastating than KC like the EMP & multi-torp, but the EMP is illegal & Polaris tech needs storyline participation. PS: you shoud also have the Pirate Jammer.

The oxygen torpedo is one of the few things that Japan did better in WW2. It had a 40km range vs 10km range for standard steam torpedoes, faster, and no steam trial to warn you since oxygen just dissolves in water. Although there were a few accidents of ~~dildos~~ torpedoes exploding due to ship damage.

## Levelling
When ships gain experience through battle in KC, they can level up & improve their stats. When they are of eligible level, they can be remodeled which brings more stats & maybe new capabilities. You will need major resources to remodel and the change is usually permanent. They may get new art & sometimes the change is drastic. The max level for a ship is usually 99. There is also the possibly of marriage when your ship is L99, which allows their max level to increase to 175 and some stats improvements. You get 1 wedding ring through some quests. More rings can be purchased from the cash shop. 

If you're trying to level your ship, you'll prolly set them as flagship which gives them a [small exp bonus](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Experience_and_Rank#Sorties) by default, but be careful of equipment & other ships, since there is a possibility of them stealing MVP, which has a higher bonus.

You have the ability to use other ships as fodder to increase the stats of a selected ship, called [modernization](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Modernization) . Since you need to have fodder of (many rare) ships it's advised to [prioritize](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Help:Modernization) your modernizations. You can also [remodel](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Remodel_\(Mechanic\)) a ship when they are of eligible level to futher increase stats. If you did modernization before, note that some effects are kept, others not. Ships whose remodels are theoretical (ships that were sunk in WW2 before they got upgraded to a certain config), you need a [blueprint](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Blueprint) and maybe other resources such as the [much-coveted](https://twitter.com/__MinT__2301/status/1255451971093499904) protopult. You can get 1 blueprint from 4 [medals](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Medal), which are obtained by (repeatable) quests, and some regular/event maps. The other resources are obtained from quests & events. Since the availability of other resources are limited, it's advised to [prioritize](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Help:Ship_Priority) your remodels. 

In EVN, having more experience & kills won't really upgrade your ship stats, but will increase your combat record, which opens up more missions. This is an important part of starting some storylines.

Battles near Fed planets are usually quite short since there's usually a defense fleet nearby. So if you want to increase your combat record and don't want NPCs to steal your kill, you need to act fast.

Apart from the upgrades of a few ships & Sigma upgrades, most player ships can't be upgraded in the way that KC ships are remodelled. But you have a more flexible outfit system. Upgrading escorts is mostly equivalent to adding outfits, but you can't choose specific outfits to add (unless you use plugins and modify them yourself).

### Transfer
In KC, you can transfer your hard-earned equipment between ships by [unequipping them](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2744889) , storing them , and equipping them onto a new ship. If you don't want a ship, you can scrap it, but any (valuable) equipment on it is also scrapped, should you forget to remove it. In late 2019, a button was introduced to scrap a ship while keeping equipment, to minimize regerts.

In EVN, outfits generally do not transfer to new ships, unless they're non-tangibles like licenses & [telekinetic abilities](https://evn.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Vell-os_Psionic_Abilities) . The profit of selling your old outfits is factored into the trade-in cost so don't bother selling your old stuff. 

## Combat
In KC, combat is mostly a passive thing depending on the outcome of the RNG-sama, with most of your preparation done before as above. You sometimes have the option of choosing your map route and advance/retreat after a node. But combat is a large part of the game. There are games in the same genre like FGO in which you get to choose the attacks, and MR which you can activate a auto-battler if you wish.

[Morale](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Morale) is a thing in KC, and can fluctuate. Good morale (sparkling) increases accuracy & evasion in combat, and better chance of more resources & exp gained during expeditions. Bad morale decreases accuracy & evasion in combat, and can fail expeditions. Morale naturally regains on a ship during sorties or expeditions. It is also increased slightly according to the outcome of battle. It is decreased by starting expeditions, battle, and returning from sorties. It is common practise to sparkle ships by having them do an easy map, then doing expeditions, harder maps, or events.

Everyone knows this, if you ship is in chuuha (medium damage) going into a battle, they can't sink (even if they get further damaged). But if a ship is taiha (high damage) going into a battle, they can sink (& sinking is usually permanent).

In EVN, combat is a very hands-on thing. By firing &/ dodging you influence the outcome. You can't be an [absent player](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2158277) , but you can pause the battle. But combat is mostly a minor aspect of the game. But if you love combat, you can hunt for Pirates/Marauders and kill them. Everyone will love you (except for Pirates). Or download a plugin like [Colosseum](https://evn.fandom.com/wiki/Colosseum) if you enjoy combat. Your combat record increases according to the number & size of ships you kill.

If you're aiming to dominate planets, you need to reach a very high combat rating of "Deadly". You can demand tribute & challenge a planet's defense fleet. If you successfully defeat them & demand tribute again, then you get a small daily pay. But again, by killing ships of a particular government, you will be hated by them & they may kill you on sight.

In KC, there is a technique known as "torpedobeats" where through careful selection of ship, formation, and optionally a [Ferrari Engine](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Enhanced_Steam_Boiler) , you can increase your chance of dodging torpedoes. In EVN, you can increase your chance of evading missiles by using a fast ship, suitable outfits, and driving.


## RNG
The general philosophy of KC and (non-combat) RNG is that with enough time & effort (incl event participation & topN of server) you can prolly get what you want. Ships can be built (or dropped after battle), and there are recipes that aim certain types, but no guarantee of getting a particular ship (even with a drop). If you use too few resources for a build, you risk a [development failure](https://en.kancollewiki.net/File:NPC_penguin.png). If you use too much you may waste resources. Similar for building equipment. You can choose a difficulty for events and the rewards scale, (although not necessarily appropriately as some people have complained about some events)

The general philosophy of EVN is that you know what you're getting, but can't always get it (unless you use cheats/exploits). For many ships & outfits, you need to play the story and ally with a government, which generally locks you out of other stories. You can board & capture ships to make your own or as escorts, but doing so you prolly earns you the hate of major governments, unless the ship is from Pirate, Marauder, or Houseless governments. RNG plays mostly a minor role in day-to-day activities, like which ships/outfits appear, the destination of regular passenger/cargo missions, which ships appear on a given day, etc. RNG does have a major role in the Polaris (major) & Wild Geese (minor) stories, and influences choice of "good" or "bad" branch. Which is fixed with the AllGoodBranches plugin.

[Old compass fairy dance easter egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUeJn5yy4Gg) .

## Ships

There's >250 player ships in KC, and about 50 distinct ships in EVN. I've put decent effort into comparing KC & EVN ship stats to make a mapping that makes orders the ships in terms of relative strength and preserves certain relationships. Mutsuki is older & worse than Fubuki. Likewise, Valkyrie is older & worse than Starbridge. I've chosen KC ships to closely match EVN ships in color, but you can choose other ships in the same class or maybe type. Yeah in KC Asashio stronk, but in EVN outcomes depend on strategy as well, not just equipment. In EVN, how dangerous a ship is depends on range & weapons. Best to lure the NPC ship into wasting its dangerous torpedoes, then fiting your own weapons from range. I have a bias towards Shibafu/kai banners to go for a more consistent/aesthetic look. I should've done an OK job of the mappings. All these ships are commonly seen, and you can buy about half of them with no storyline mission prerequisite.

You can heart-lock ships that you like, to prevent them from being (auto)-selected for modernization or scrapping purposes.

### Auroran & Generic
In EVN, Aurorans are a warrior race with inferior technology but strong spirits, and red as a theme color, kinda like the IJN. But in WW2, Japan were "the bad guys", but in EVN they're tying reform the evil Federation. You can purchase generic/civilian ships with the right licenses, but you must play the Auroran storyline to buy some of these ships.

![Akagi](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/d/d1/KanMusu404Banner.png)	![Auroran Carrier](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/7/75/Nova_rleD_1050.gif)
Akagi is Auroran Carrier

![Mogami](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/1/19/KanMusu051Banner.png)	![Auroran Cruiser](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/3/3a/Nova_rleD_1052_s1.gif)
Mogami is Auroran Cruiser

![Agano](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/1/19/KanMusu137Banner.png)	![IDA Frigate](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/a/ac/Nova_rleD_1024.gif)
Agano is IDA Frigate. I was gonna map Akitsu Maru to the Frigate. But decided otherwise cuz Naka-Agano-Nagano can map to Enterprise-Frigate-P'Enterprise since all 3 ships use the IDA engine. Agano is mostly better than Naka in KC. The IDA Frigate is better than the Enterprise in EVN cuz it doesn't have a blind spot in the center, and is smaller=less area for missiles to hit.

![Naka](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/4/47/KanMusu160Banner.png)	![Enterprise](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/b/bc/Nova_rleD_1022.gif)
Naka is Auroran Enterprise. I was gonna say Zuihou, for the historical connection.



![Kagerou](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/8/81/KanMusu091Banner.png)	![Abomination](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/8/8d/Nova_rleD_1048.gif)
Kagerou is Auroran Abomination. Kagerou got the quad-torpedo launcher. Likewise, the Abomination got the Fusion Pulse Canons. You could choose anyone else from the bike shorts (Kagerou) class except for Taihou, or a strong DD, really.

![Shikanami](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/9/9a/KanMusu427Banner.png)	![Mod Starbridge](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/6/63/Nova_rleD_1074.gif/revision/latest?cb=20190919003613)	
Shikanami is Mod Starbridge. I've put these 3 civilian ships with this bunch of KC kanmusu. Shikanami is an upgraded Fubuki, which is again as an upgraded Mutsuki. Their usage is similar in EVN, small, versatile ships that can fight or frieght.

![Fubuki](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/9/96/KanMusu226Banner.png)	![Starbridge](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/6/6f/Nova_rleD_1010.gif)
Fubuki is Starbridge. Fubuki appears in a lot of KC marketing material & the splash. Similarly, the Starbridge appears on the game icon & splash. You could also choose another kanmusu from the [Potato class](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Category:Fubuki_Class) . In KC, Shikanami is sometimes better than Fubuki except in a few areas (might depend on play style). Likewise for EVN, Mod is sometimes better than original. Except for jump speed. If you have any time-critical missions, use the original (not many worthwhile ones in the stock scenario tho).

![Mutsuki](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/b/b5/KanMusu234Banner.png)	![Valkyrie](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/f/ff/Nova_rleD_1018.gif)
Mutsuki is Valkyrie. Both are based on older technology. If you want to improve your trading gains, you can equip a ~~[Daihatsu](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/3627268?)~~ cargo expansion. Unlike KC, cargo expansion can be fitted to most shpis, as long as you have the space.


![Etofuru](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/f/f6/KanMusu334Banner.png)	![Phoenix](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/f/fb/Nova_rleD_1056.gif)
Etofuru is Auroran Phoenix.


![Maruyu](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/d/dc/KanMusu163Banner.png)	![Shuttle](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/3/3c/Nova_rleD_1000.gif)
Maruyu is Shuttle. A few hits and it's ded. But you can put 10t of cargo in it.


### Rebel
I've mapped KC Italians to Rebels, which have a green theme. Italian botes are blonde, but the Italian flag has green on it. There was some collaboration between Italy & Japan in WW2 just like there's possibly collaboration btw Aurorans & Rebels (after you finish EVN). You must play the Rebel storyline to buy all of these ships.
 
![Zara](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/5/58/KanMusu248Banner.png)	![Rebel Destroyer](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/6/6c/Nova_rleD_1106.gif)	
Zara is Rebel Destroyer 

![Maestrale](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/4/40/KanMusu375Banner.png)	![Rebel Starbridge](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/f/ff/Nova_rleD_1100.gif)	
Maestrale is Rebel Starbridge

### Federation
I have mapped KC US to Federation ships in EVN. Both have blue as a theme color. You must play the Fed storyline to buy all of these ships.

![Intrepid](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/6/68/KanMusu349Banner.png)	![Federation Carrier](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/4/40/Nova_rleD_1030.gif)
Intrepid is Federation Carrier

![Houston](https://yksk.kancollewiki.net/w/images/7/71/KanMusu395Banner.png)	![Destroyer](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/5/52/Nova_rleD_1026.gif)	
Houston is Federation Destroyer

There are other ships in EVN, but I haven't mapped them to KC ships cuz I don't think they're close enough. Mainly Vell-os and Polaris ships since they're overpowered and rather unconventional-looking. There is a Lightning & Thunderhead (pictured above). You can map them to Inazuma & Ikazuchi based on name. But then the Inazuma & Ikazuchi in EVN would have much less shields than the Fubuki & co in KC, which is very untrue. You could also map Lightning to Shimakaze, for its speed & appearance, but I refrained, again for low shields. There is also a Thunderforge which is about as fast as Kongou, but (more) powerful than a Musashi (depending on range).

### Naming
KC ships are named like their IJN counterpart. There are [conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_ship-naming_conventions) , like CVs named after flying things, and DDs after natural phenomena. Shoukaku = soaring crane, Souryuu = blue dragon. Fubuki=blizzard, Shirayuki=white snow. Poetic names.

In EVN, some ships have generic names. Some cargo ships are named after mythical creatures, like Terrapin, Pegasus, Leviathan. Vell-os and Polaris ships can have names like Javelin, Arachnid, Scarab. Slightly poetic. There is a Dragon in EVN, but it's black w/ flourescent coloring, and it might not carry by default. But it has enough space for a fighter bay.

## Map

In KC as of late 2020, there are 7 worlds and 34 maps. If you assume 10 nodes per map, then you have 340 total nodes. But not all nodes have battles. So there's prolly >200 with battles. The art for each battle looks mostly the same, unlike other F2P games like FGO/MR. The enemies at nodes can vary, chosen from a few pre-defined patterns.

![EVN map small](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/a/aa/Evnovamap.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400)

In the EVN default scenario, there are [>400 systems](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/a/aa/Evnovamap.jpg) , but only about 300 space objects. Not all of them are landable. So there's prolly >200 landable spobs. For each landable spob, there's some art, but it's prolly obscured much of the time by a dialog you open. Ships that appear in each system have a pre-defined chance of appearing, so the combination you see can vary between days.

## Story
Apart from killing aliens, there's not really a story (in contrast with FGO/MR). Maybe "we fight to keep the peace?". Maybe the aim is to be a [hard](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/3809592) game and to sorta represent the complexity of managing a navy & the losses of the IJN in WW2. [More discussion](https://old.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/jiq2t2/discussion_its_about_time_kancolle_nationalism/) . According to this [blog on wikia](https://kancolle.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Morgane_of_the_Mists/Cultural_exchange,_pt._1) , Japan likes to not talk about its past in a serious way. But maybe there's a hivemind sentiment that they don't want war again.

EVN OTOH, has 6 major storylines & several minor ones. I guess you could say there's a message depending on which storyline you play. The Federation has been internally usurped by the evil Beureau. By joining 1 of the 6 major governments, you can reform the Federation (and bring a message of hope), rule cooperatively, or further the reach of the Beureau and commit genocide (maybe the message is genocide is bad). Since EVN isn't a modern F2P or VN game, there's no in-game library to re-read the text. So you need to travel to the planet to read the description, or use the [EVN wiki]( https://evn.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Genocide) . Also unlike some VNs, there is no singular "true route" that is unlocked after playing the story several times. Most of them are vaguely reinforce that the Federation loses some power. Only in the Fed storyline does the Federation increase in power. The Pirate storyline is more like a side story in that there's no change in the Fed power (although it locks you out from other stories).

## Conclusion
Hopefully I've convinced you to play EVN, if not, enjoyed reading my comparison.
