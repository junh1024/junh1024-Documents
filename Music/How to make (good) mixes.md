# How to make (good) mixes

A mix is a 


Concept

I usually make thematic mixes (& hence cohesive), with the theme being genre. Why genre? Cuz genre implies some closeness in instruments & BPM. Pop is a meta-genre ie, songs aren't really close. I always have problems with pop.

Unlike mashups, knowing theory is almost mandatory for makng good mixes.

If you're like me, you would've heard the circle of 5ths being mentioned many times, but not knowing how it's useful, until now. Here it is below in strip form with C major at the center, and relative minor below.

C#	G#	D#	A#	F	[C]	G	D	A	E	b	F#
a#	f	c	g	d	[a]	e	b	f#	c#	g#	d#

If you join 2 songs in neighboring keys or modes (move horizontally or vertically), it might sound good. But if you move both (move horizontally and vertically), it might not.

Fades

You can do fades to join 2 clips. The simplest fade is a crossfade, where 1 clip (slowly) fades out while the other fades in. Your DAW may do automatic crossfades if you overlap 2 clips, or you can manually fade 2 clips on separate tracks for more control. You could also do a L-fade where 1 clip fades out but the other cuts in.

As for length of fade, what's appropriate can vary by genre. So for house, there's the standard 32 beat or 8 bad crossfade. But for rock, a fast fade or a cut may be appropriate. For pop, it's ticky & depends on song.
