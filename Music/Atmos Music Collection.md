# Atmos Music Collection

## Introduction

There is a lack of free & well-mixed Atmos music on the internet, so I have created my own collection available for free. I have spent many hours mixing & negotiating permissions. Permissions have already been cleared, or don't need to be cleard cuz they're public domain or due to distribution method.
They are sorted into several volumes:

1. General
2. Reserved
3. Reserved
4. Reserved
5. Classical
6. Classical
7. Reserved
8. Reserved
9. Reserved

Some songs & volumes may be unfinished. See my [mixing notes](https://github.com/junh1024/junh1024-Documents/blob/master/Music/Atmos%20Music%20Mixing%20Notes.md#introduction)
