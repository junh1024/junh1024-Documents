- u/virtualworld314 . I [have doubts](https://old.reddit.com/r/animemusic/comments/gignzg/hiii_3_im_a_japanese_artist_if_just_one_person/) but if you say so it must be true, right?
- u/tokaka you're in Japan, that counts. inb4 Tonio's emotional Anime mix.

My idea is that G# is the single key with the highest proportion of emotional songs. 

G#= G# major, G# minor, Fm, but the relative major is G#. This covers 3/(4*12+2) of default modes, +2 fudge factor for non-default modes or 6% chance of sounding G# if we assume keys are evenly distributed. Or you can 1.5x that if you think they aren't. Spotify did a key analysis. [Article](https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2015/05/the-most-popular-keys-of-all-music-on-spotify.html) & [Graph](http://web.archive.org/web/20161206052806/https://spotifyinsights.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/keys.png). Summing my 3 cases with spotify gives 8%, so I was sorta close.

By emotional I mean it sounds emotional &/ used in an emotional context. I can't really understand Asian, so it's my opinion based on the melody. I have used remixes when it's in the same key, but also cuz I'm more familiar with that. I think they're just as, if not more emotional than the original.

Background
---
I make mixes. My 1st longform mix was a [Rock Mix](https://hearthis.at/jzgmyrcb/dal-op-c3-op24/), and I noticed there was a lot of [D & D#](https://i.imgur.com/aInzur5.png). I've been told that this is due to the strings on a guitar. For my [House1](https://hearthis.at/jzgmyrcb/houseanime51k-3/KGQ/), House2 & [Orch1](https://hearthis.at/jzgmyrcb/orchestralmix51c/) mixes, the climax/emotional songs happen to be G#, and I build my mix around those, often in reverse. So I was wondering whether G# is special. Other/less emotional songs tend to be in not G#, full [key analyses here](https://imgur.com/a/Bog9GyC).


Instrumentation
---
Reading the spotify article, the reason why G, D and C are popular is cuz they're easy to play on Piano & Guitar, which are common instruments in Pop music. Looking at my songs above, I see a lot of vocals, synths, some piano & strings, but not a lot of guitar. So I take it that G# is hard for guitar. Vocals & synths (especially computers) is probably easy to play in any key. G# on Piano is annoying, but doable. I don't play violin so I looked up "how hard is g# key on violin" & I found [this dude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qY_UlM7kYU). He makes it look easy, but IDK if thats the case IRL, so u/ZeroFPS_hk I'd like your input. I think strings & piano influence how emotional a song is.

Conclusion
---

There are a few more I cut out, but you get the idea that G# is the single key with the highest proportion of emotional songs. But it turns out F#, C#, or D would be contenders. Did Macross start this trend in 1984? There are several biases. Like confirmation, songsiknow/key, smallsamplesize bias. Or maybe I'm wrong? Discuss.

>Hmm well top of my head of emotional anime music I thought of Counter Attack from snk (f# min) and luminous sword from sao (e min) so I would say that it all probably comes down to listener and composer preference? Also I've always been more of a flat guy myself, so I would call it Ab instead of G# haha??

>I don't think difficulty of key really factors in heavily here, most pro musicians should have no problem playing in any key (where's the any key??) so again I think it's down to what keys the composer likes,

Yes, if you're pro, but as I said above, I think you'd rather play in an easier key. But there's also benefit if it is in an easier key = more people can play it = they make covers = your song gets more popular = more money for you.

>maybe with director/studio input

I don't think non-music people know about keys. Also AFAIK most music is made in advance. For anime OPED, the label may have an artist & song they're trynna promote, they pair it with an anime, suddenly it's anime. It's a clique of companies. For anime score, I read a Shinji Miyazaki interview about Pokemon . IIRC he was asked to compose a bunch of pieces with different moods then they pick the piece that suits the scene.

>Strings however certainly sound better in keys closer to their tunings but meh it all sounds good to me anyways haha!!

Yeah so strings may be ever so slightly out of tune depending on tuning & players, but as long as it's not too out of tune, the multiple deviations can result in a richer sound.
