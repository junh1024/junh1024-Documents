Introduction
---
This is a subjective list, influenced by what I know, so it might be a bit wrong.

Fast Rock
---
Rock songs >= 180bpm, like [school food punishment - light prayer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vOkageaKdk) . Or the ones in my Fast Rock mix (I've spammed that enough so you can find the link in my [previous article]()). I think it started around 2005. Some drummers can play that fast, but much of the time, drums in pop are sampled for convenience &/ control. school food punishment has disbanded but Yanagi Nagi has done some of this. I'd also like to say that she has good taste in music as she covered that for her euaru album. 

Emo Rock
---
Also around 2005 were western emo-rock bands like My Chemical Romance & Fall Out Boy. J-Pop has taken that and turned it dark with artists like [minami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIRiduzNLzQ) . Notice she has a really breathy voice which cuts above the wideband electric guitars. Which leads me to my next trend:

Breathy voices
---
Breathy voices probably started being popular around 2010. This sort of thing wasn't really common in 2000s, you had more tonal voices. In music production, you usually want to remove breath noises. There are dedicated VSTs or processing modules for this. But there's also exciters, etc to enhance this. Voices like [Etsuko Yakushimaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHutOselSBE) and [Yanagi Nagi] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgNBtuobT1c) . I think the idea with breathiness is that you get to be 'closer' to the singer.

Dubstep ruining good songs (transient?)
---
I think I was listening to a Key remix CD. There were a few good songs on there, but there was at least 1 song that was ruined by a wubsteb bit in the middle. And also in [Ray - sign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx8rYGl7XJg)  there's this annoying wideband synth in the verse. Completely not needed.


6-8 Time (declining use)
---
In 95+% of (pop) songs, you count to 4 to make a bar. In others, you count to 3, 6 or another number, which makes them special. It's not about how it sounds, but rather how it feels.  Alicia Keys' "Fallin'" & "If I Ain't got You" is in 6/8. My [6/8 time mix](https://hearthis.at/jzgmyrcb/6-8segue51k4/) is also full of tuple-time songs , (yes u/tokaka it's all originals so you can listen to it). The AVERAGE_YEAR is 2005, so I assume use is declining. There were some talented composers around 90s and 00s to compose a bunch of 6/8 for CCS and other series, but I get the feeling it's declining. Though you get the occasional new blood like Yanagi Nagi with a few 6/8. She's talented.

One of the problems with the transition to digital audio & PCs is that many DAWs just default to 4/4 for a new project and you'll probably never change that. Whereas with scoring apps, you may need to choose when you start, and if you have a physical paper with staves it's just blank staves. Well, a default of 4/4 is convenient & saves time for most cases. But it also depends on what meter your ideas come in. I'll say most of my ideas come in 4/4 with the occasional 3/4 or whatever. It's hard to think of a way to encourage people to write more tuple time songs, without making apps annoying.


Key changes (declining use)
---
A key change is a change in the root of the key. Using this technique, you can increase the apparent energy of the music, without adding anything. [Let's not say goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0CnFW1cqfQ)  Starts with Em in the verse, changes to E for the pre-chorus (actually only a mode change), then elevates to G# for the chorus. And finally goes back down to Em again for the 2nd verse. They try to make it seamless by choosing specific chords/progressions & inversions. You don't need to get as complex as this, but an easy way to incorporate it into a pop song is simply by raising the key by 1 or 2 st during the last chorus. But it seems like not even this is being done recently. I'll also like to call out that even apps that allow you to tag  songs with keys, don't allow you to tag multiple keys, unless it's in an arbitrary/non-dedicated field like comments.

Conclusion
---
J-Pop music is moving to be simpler and catering to consumer preferences, to make money. Not immune to western influences
