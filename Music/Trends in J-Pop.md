# Trends in J-Pop

Introduction
---
This is a subjective list, influenced by what I know, so it might be a bit wrong.

Fast Rock
---
Rock songs >= 180bpm, like [school food punishment - light prayer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vOkageaKdk) . Or the ones in my Fast Rock mix (I've spammed that enough so you can find the link in my [previous article](https://github.com/junh1024/junh1024-Documents/blob/master/Music/G%23%20is%20the%20most%20emotional%20key%20for%20Anime%20music.md#definitions)). I think it started around 2005. Some drummers can play that fast, but much of the time, drums in pop are sampled for convenience &/ control. school food punishment has disbanded but Yanagi Nagi has done some of this. I'd also like to say that she has good taste in music as she covered that for her euaru album. 

Dark Lyrical Rock
---
Not sure of the origins but it's gotta be western influenced. [minami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIRiduzNLzQ) . Notice she has a really breathy voice which cuts above the wideband electric guitars. Which leads me to my next trend:

Breathy voices
---
Breathy voices probably started being popular around 2010. This sort of thing wasn't really common in 2000s, you had more tonal voices. In music production, you usually want to remove breath noises. There are dedicated VSTs or processing modules for this. But there's also exciters, etc to enhance this. Voices like [Etsuko Yakushimaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHutOselSBE) and [Yanagi Nagi] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgNBtuobT1c) . I think the idea with breathiness is that you get to be 'closer' to the singer.

Dubstep ruining good songs (transient?)
---
I think I was listening to a Key remix CD. There were a few good songs on there, but there was at least 1 song that was ruined by a wubsteb bit in the middle. And also in [Ray - sign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx8rYGl7XJg)  there's this annoying wideband synth in the verse. Completely not needed.

Conclusion
---
J-Pop music is moving to be simpler and catering to consumer preferences, to make money. Not immune to western influences

Abuse of Autotune ()
---
In the olden days, mixers just applied lots of reverb to cover up small intonations of big artists, and it sounded natural and fine. Nowdays, we don't need reverb, we can just manipulate pitch at well to fix or mangle problems. You do not need to buy the premium brand Antares AutoTune to get it. It may be included in your cheaper DAW, eg., Logic has Pitch Correction, Fruity Loops has NewTone, REAPER has ReaTune, or there are even [free ones](https://cymatics.fm/blogs/production/free-autotune-vst-plugins). We'll just have to accept that you may never hear vocals without Autotune/pitch correction, unless you record it yourself. Even leaks of older material when AT didn't exist, have AT put on to protect our image of our idols.

My problem with AT is that people use it with bad settings, or maybe it has bad defaults, and don't listen/check for artefacts.
[Nakeru Anison](dd) . An otherwise emotional experience is ruined by artefacts all over the album.

Abuse of 4536
---
4536 is a chord progression. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKV58VVGV9k for an explanation & examples. Or use [my example of Hoshi no Waltz](https://youtu.be/KsqbqeSrPjY?t=42), listen to the chorus. The proper notation is IV V iii vi, but I'm shortening it to 4536. The minor equivalent is 6751 (+2). There's chord abbreviations & variations like 436 in his [part 2 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne_9UnKcSb4&t=41s). It's used a lot in J-Pop (found in at least 10-50% of songs) [Here's a list](https://pastebin.com/G0AUcZvp) I made with songs which have 4536 or similar.

How did it start? Probably Jazz & western music theory. Yuno, the Japanese might have a habit of taking the best of western things & incorporating it, at least with music.  They're smart people. I found a [thread on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/4jfwyr/why_is_this_chord_progression_so_common_in/). Summarizing the best answers from u/chunter16 & u/gnad , maybe they got it from like, 70s W-Pop, but it never went out of fashion in Japan maybe due to the [Galapagos Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galapagos_effect). But also because it's handy. You can do loops of 4536, and then end it whenever with a 251 (a perfect/resolving cadence). You can find variations of 4536 in modern western musiclike [Trademark - Something Only Love Can Do](https://youtu.be/P_IGBqm4MA0?t=48), slightly more common in R&B like [Nelly/Rowland - Dilemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WYHDfJDPDc) , but it's a lot more popular in Japan/Asia. or there was another in A#m with a bouncing scale from  F D#. Slightly older song .

The **problem** is have with it is that, a lot of the time it's abused to  make songs quickly for low-effort releases, e.g, Anime character singles which are really, an excercise in making money (Lucky Star had 13 character singles). Sometimes they're good (the Nagato Yuki 2006 CS has a 6/8 song), but that's the exception rather than the norm. And sometimes there are supposedly high-effort releases abuse 4536 very blatantly, without using any devices to make interesting like tempo, key, or meter changes. Example: Claris' [Alicia/Shibunaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q12kHKOYz_k) , 1-2 have heavy use of 4536, and 3 has 456.


6-8 Time (declining use)
---
In 95+% of (pop) songs, you count to 4 to make a bar. In others, you count to 3, 6 or another number, which makes them special. It's not about how it sounds, but rather how it feels.  Alicia Keys' "Fallin'" & "If I Ain't got You" is in 6/8. My [6/8 time mix](https://hearthis.at/jzgmyrcb/6-8segue51k4/) is also full of tuple-time songs , (yes u/tokaka it's all originals so you can listen to it). The AVERAGE_YEAR is 2005, so I assume use is declining. There were some talented composers around 90s and 00s to compose a bunch of 6/8 for CCS and other series, but I get the feeling it's declining. Though you get the occasional new blood like Yanagi Nagi with a few 6/8. She's talented.

One of the problems with the transition to digital audio & PCs is that many DAWs just default to 4/4 for a new project and you'll probably never change that. Whereas with scoring apps, you may need to choose when you start, and if you have a physical paper with staves it's just blank staves. Well, a default of 4/4 is convenient & saves time for most cases. But it also depends on what meter your ideas come in. I'll say most of my ideas come in 4/4 with the occasional 3/4 or whatever. It's hard to think of a way to encourage people to write more tuple time songs, without making apps annoying.


Key changes (declining use)
---
A key change is a change in the root of the key. Using this technique, you can increase the apparent energy of the music, without adding anything. [Let's not say goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0CnFW1cqfQ)  Starts with Em in the verse, changes to E for the pre-chorus (actually only a mode change), then elevates to G# for the chorus. And finally goes back down to Em again for the 2nd verse. They try to make it seamless by choosing specific chords/progressions & inversions. You don't need to get as complex as this, but an easy way to incorporate it into a pop song is simply by raising the key by 1 or 2 st during the [last chorus](https://youtu.be/EgGnreyPmaQ?t=203). But it seems like not even this is being done recently. I'll also like to call out that even apps that allow you to tag  songs with keys, don't allow you to tag multiple keys, unless it's in an arbitrary/non-dedicated field like comments.
