# Tamako Love Story - Music Commentary

Instruments taken from the booklet

Rhythm: E.Guitar/A.Guitar, Percussion/Drums, Double Bass
Strings: Violin, Violin, Viola, Cello
Winds/Brass: Soprano/Tenor Sax, Trumpet, Trombone, Bassoon

Piano, Flute, Organ, pitched percussion is probably VSTi.

So we have a small/medium-size ensemble of various pop/orchestral instruments that can make a decent variety of sounds. A small ensemble to reflect the simplicity of youth, and  also due to budget reasons. I think it was made on a reduced budget since the picture is worth approx. 720p & the soundtrack is stereo, not surround.

Why one key?
---

~~If you'll listen to the " Tamako Love Story OST" album, you'll notice that a lot of the songs are in F. What you can do with one key? Well, it gives you flexibility since you can rearrange neighboring songs and it'll still sound OK. Also, they'll flow really nicely.~~

Why F?
---
As I said in a previous document, 

~~[G# is the most emotional key for Anime music.md] F was probably chosen due to being easier to play on certain (transposing) instruments. A transposing instrument is such that if you write a C4, they'll play something else. And for many, that's Bb. In the instrument list, we have 2x Bb Sax, and a trumpet. They play a lead role in a few songs. For strings & guitar, the difficulty of F is probably average. I used to play piano & I know the keys C,D,F,G are easy.~~
