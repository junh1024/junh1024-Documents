# Shorthand Relative Chord Notation System

The purpose of this system is a short & fast chord system, that can be easily used for handwritten analysis in real-time, or a simple system for music analysis in the context of remixing. Something similar may've been done before. Because it's a relative system, the absolute key is not written for chords, so it's good to write it at the start, e.g, 1=C. My system assumes a major key, so for minor keys please use its relative major, but note it like so: 1=C/Am. 

**Default modes**

So for major keys, the traditional system looks like this, with capitals denoting major & smallcase for minor like this:

I	ii	iii	IV	V	vi	vii

We can simplify it to just

1	2	3	4	5	6	7

**Alternate modes**

Old: III & iv (major, minor)
New: 3M & 4m

**Extended/jazz chords**

Old: V7	V9	V11
New: 57 59 511

A chord can't exceed 7, so any number >10 means extended chord.

**Key change**
_K <new key>
_K G

**Inversions**

Old: iiib
New: 3b

**More complex example**

Old: IIIb
New: 3Mb (yeah uhh this is a bit awkward)

It's really not meant to be a complex system encompassing all possible chords, but it enough for the cases above.
