# Shorthand Relative Chord Notation System

The purpose of this system is a short & fast chord system, that can be easily used for handwritten analysis in real-time, or a simple system for music analysis in the context of remixing. Something similar may've been done before.

Because it's a relative system, the absolute key is not written for chords, so it's good to write it at the start, e.g, 1=C. So for major keys, the traditional system looks like this, with capitals denoting major & smallcase for minor like this:

I	ii	iii	IV	V	vi	vii

We can simplify it to just

1	2	3	4	5	6	7

For alternate modes, the traditional system reverses the capitalization e.g,

III & iv (3 major, 4 minor), but in my system it is

3M & 4m. Note that capital M means major & small m means minor (similar to other systems).

For extended/jazz chords:
V7	V9	V11

57 59 511
A chord can't exceed 7, so any number >10 means extended chord.

Inversions:
iiib

3b

More complex example, major 3rd, inverted.
3Mb (yeah uhh this is a bit awkward)

It's really not meant to be a complex system encompassing all possible chords, but it enough for the cases above.
