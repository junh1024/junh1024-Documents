# If you like the Ridge Racer PSP OST, you might like these other OSTs

Introduction
---
Ridge Racer PSP OST is the best OST in the series imo. I've only played it for an hour or so in 2006-ish, but it has good music (I like 1/4-1/2 of the tracks). But I'm biased since I barely know the other OSTs well. But I might be [onto something](https://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/ridgeracers.shtml). It has a mix of new songs and remixes of old songs. Including the irresistible [Disco Ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3GLPLsjD24)But I don't like the hardcore tracks. While I'm going through game OSTs to make mixes, I noticed a few that might fit into RR PSP.

Test Drive Unlimited 1 PS2
---
TDU is a racing lifestyle game developed by eden/atari, and released by atari in 2007 for PC & PS2. The PS2/PSP version, apart from licensed songs, has a bunch of exclusive instrumental songs composed by Gavin Parker, son of the notable Marshall Parker. Some points: 

- [Sunshower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRUDaUnvF8Y) sounds like it might come from Ace Combat 3/4 due to the pad motif.
- [Wiki wiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBRgr9OlCdo) sounds very much like [Tek Trek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_StCqgqydtg) from RR PSP. They're both in the same key, and have delay on the synths & interval of 4ths on the pads. But he's added some arps at the end & tropical percussion at the start (since TDU is set in Oahu, Hawaii)
- There are [other songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUpIqif6rE4), mainly on the 'Maximum Beats' part that sound like they'd fit in the RR OST due to (psy)-trance being a component of RR PSP OST. They're a bit repetitive & not as distinctive as the ones in RR PSP, but I can't blame him entirely as 1 person composed 3 discs worth of music for TDU1, rather than 5-10 people composing 2 discs worth for RR PSP.

Outrun 2006

Like RR, OR is also an arcade racer series, but developed by SEGA. It also has a variety of tracks for the variety in scenery. To note are the versions remixed for this game. Like, Splash Wave Euro Remix & Passing Breeze Euro Remix. You can [check them out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTxNpFdvmAI&list=PL_BhbJAAueZRGIUQiJttJc7Sl7OjThLIP&index=17) yourself.

Touhou Trance
---
Touhou is a bullet shooter game for PC by Team Shanghai Alice. It's notable for its music since there are many fan-made remixes in many different styles. If you liked the NuJazz-style [Blue Topaz remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydwDBr9MoA) and regular Trance, you may like [estha - Blue State](https://youtu.be/YMiYhSVbpYo?t=926) (as part of my Touhou 2 mix) since the bassline is similar and there are key changes & polyphony.
