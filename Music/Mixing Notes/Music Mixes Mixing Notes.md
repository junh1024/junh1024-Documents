# Music Mixes Mixing Notes

## Introduction
Most of these are available on my [junh1024 YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGqlhiQ9Eu-zsIdK_NRecdQ)

## Racing Mixes
Originally I thought to have separate TDU & NFS series for a brief while, but decided to combine them. I opened separate projects for TDU & NFS importing. I did combined imports for each series, split them off into their own projects, then moved songs between each as necessary. As Charlie https://blog.chiariglione.org/a-future-without-mpeg/ quoted from the 3 kingdoms, " things divided for a long time shall unite, things united for a long time shall divide", only this was a much shorter period. As with the Touhou series, I had a problem of running 2 different styles of mixes in the same series, I opted for the same odd-even approach. Odd number = slow/rock songs, Even = fast/electronic songs. So I re-numbered the TDU & NFS mixes.




## DnB 2
I decided to make my own DnB mix (w/ some VGM) after I listened to "Concord Dawn - The Chaos Mix", and finding it weird & unsatisfactory. It's 170bpm, which is slightly slow, but still feels DnB. There's some tricky cutting & stretching in Barrier Break to keep in on-grid, while the song changes bpm. There's some breaks towards the end to represent you need to take more breaks as you get older (aka I couldn't find a better way to do transitions). Some EQ tweaks to make it sound cohesive, and stereo narrowing to make it more pleasant. With commercial DnB i work less hard than 2hu Doujin music to balance bass/EQ, tho there's still some slight work to make it sound consistent

## Classics and Cheese

44'40"/7 songs = 6.4 mins/song

Cosmocrator also indicated their cheese selections using a scale, but with less precision. The cheese spectrum & coefficients was initially a way of satirically complying with the rules, but also acknowledging the non-binary nature of cheese given the previous attempts to classify songs. But it seems people agreed with the concept &/ coefficients. The string "M 0.3" looks vaguely like a [Messier object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object)

Following my seminal statement on DC that cheese is a spectrum, here's the Cheese coefficients:

- Synaesthesia 0.2
- Death of Aase 0.2
- Don't Give Up 0.4
- Nothing But You 0.2
- Feel The Beat 0.7
- M 0.3
- Insolation 0.2

*Grand total: 2.2 cheeses*

So this is my 1st classic trance submission, and my 1st mostly Western trance mix. It sounds like someone that doesn't know trance but knows good taste, as my song selection isn't particularly obscure. Also my transitions 8 bars instead of the 16 bars. Most songs are Classic Trance & appear on the r/Trance "Hall of Fame", except Death of Aase, which is *Classical Trance*.

Also, this mix would have almost qualified for The [Inner Light contest](https://old.reddit.com/r/ClassicTrance/comments/v28qfb/rclassictrance_announces_inner_light_a_new_mix/) (except for Insolation from 2007) since it sort of represents myself since it includes classical and J-pop-inspired selections, and short house-style transitions.

My mix could also serve as a short introduction to trance classics for newcomers (and also appeal to the regulars) rather than listening to 100 "In Search of Sunrise" albums and 9001 ASOT episodes, since, ain't nobody got time for that. I also recall in a earlier contest, there was a submission that seemed to just join a bunch of classics without consideration of order or transitions. So if you were to just join a bunch of classics, then this would be the way to do it.

So at the start of May 2024, I have some mix projects, but they won't qualify for this contest since they have songs after 2008. After listening to discussions of cheese songs on the Discord, there were a few good songs to include in a mix. After adding in the few Western Trance songs I know and wanted to include in a mix and taking out the ones that didn't fit, my mix is formed. The order of the songs is in a large part determined by the keys with Synaesthesia definitely at the start, don't give up near the middle, and M near the end. Although this is a DAW mix, some of the transitions still sound a bit bad due to my style.

Additional notes: this mix was finished after my "Around the World" submission, and I realize it's "Around the World" in a sense, we got a fair bit of Dutch & UK, with a bit of Finnish production, Japanese vocals, and Norwegian composition & lyrics. Or mostly just around Europe.

### About songs

The Thrillseekers is an alias of Steve Helstrip (UK DJ & producer). Synesthesia took about six months to finish compared to their usual two weeks for a trance song due to production and detail.

G & A Project is Geert Huinink (Dutch DJ) & Alco Lammers. This is a remix of Edvard Grieg's Death of Aase, a well-known classical song from G&A Project's Classical Trance remix album. It seems that they did this project due to Huinink's love of classical music.

Chicane is Nicholas Bracegirdle (UK DJ & producer). Bracegirdle deliberately left Bryan Adams vocal credits off the record to prove a point - the music makes a good song, not the vocal credit.

Chicane is Nicholas Bracegirdle (UK DJ & producer). Bracegirdle deliberately left Bryan Adams vocal credits off the record since some of the elite hipster DJs wouldn't play a cool record solely due to the un-cool vocal credit. His point was later proven after it became a massive hit - the music makes a good song, not the vocal credit. The single was re-released digitally in 2012 with [new artwork](https://www.discogs.com/release/26808086-Chicane-Feat-Bryan-Adams-Dont-Give-Up) , likely inspired by the Sisyphus meme

Paul van Dyk is a (German DJ & producer). The vocals featured in the track are Norwegian. The lyric "Jeg har ingenting, men jeg har alt når jeg har deg" translates to "I have nothing, but I have everything when I have you." The Cirrus remix is highly acclaimed and was featured in Need for Speed Underground 2

Darude is a (Finnish DJ & producer). "Feel the Beat" shares many musical similarities with his previous hit single "Sandstorm", and is 1 semitone lower in key. Although 1 internet user remarked that it sounds like "Feel the Meat"

Above & Beyond is a English music group of Tony, Jono, and Paavo. In 2002, "Above & Beyond made their DJ debut in Tokyo, performing for 8,000 clubbers alongside Ferry Corsten and Tiesto." and i guess this is how the Japan connection with Hamasaki came about. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_%26_Beyond_(band) & https://trancehistory.com/2021/10/28/ayumi-hamasaki-m-above-beyond-rmx/

It's a very well-made trance song, and is 1 of the only trance songs with Japanese vocals that's well-known outside Japan. As ckuskner from Discogs puts it, "if you don't know the Above & Beyond remix of "M" you don't know trance." It appears in Armin's ASOT top 1000 at position 177.

Ferry Corsten is a Dutch DJ & producer with a bazillion aliases (incl System F). I like Insolation better, but it's totally eclipsed in popularity by Out of the Blue from the same album. GPT4 says: "Listeners appreciate the energetic and uplifting nature of the track, typical of Ferry Corsten’s style. However, detailed reviews are sparse, and it seems to be a well-regarded but somewhat niche release in the trance community"

### Cut songs

Maximum Tune - maximum acceleration. I know this song because it was in a game music video called Maverick Strikes Back. But it wasn't used since the intensity would be too much as a 2nd song, and much of the time the 2nd song drops in intensity after the 1st song.

I could include Sunbright (Brightest Sunflowers Remix), which would lead into Way Out West - Killa, but Sunbright is from 2018 (so won't qualify) and Killa sounds a bit off since it's sped up from 130.

I was considered using DJ Sammy - we're in heaven to fulfill the cheese requirements, but it was too short.

Aurora UK - Ordinary World 2009
Oakenfold - ready go C#m
MBWR - Endless roads F#m


- Yuzo Koshiro Maximum Tune OST - Maximum Acceleration Gm
- Yuichiro Tsukagoshi & Ayaka Kitazawa - Sunbright (Brightest Sunflowers Remix) 2018 D#
- Way out West - Killa Em _END


With the inclusion of Paul van Dyk - Reflection, this could be an "Origins" mix of some of the songs I use in my game mixes, like MBWR - Can You Hear Me is inspired by Chicane's Saltwater, and MBWR Endless Roads is inspired by Chicane - Offshore. But those two Chicane songs wouldn't fit. Pi from gusgus vs t world album I also wanted to use in a mix, but again it's not trance. I wanted to use that song since on that album is also purple, of which a remix was used in Test Drive Unlimited.

### How I know these songs

Synaesthesia. I was looking for songs on the web to put in my mix. I wanted trance songs popular enough for the pop charts. I found a web page with popular trance songs, and Synaesthesia stood out to me, and it sounded OK on YouTube. One upload claiming to be the original version is actually the 2004 en-motion mix. The reason I listened to it is prolly I confused it with Junkie XL's Synaesthesia. Another reason that I liked it because it sounded similar to [Pastry - Ghost Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb0raMGudcs), which I also used at the start of another mix.

Death of Aase. I'm not sure how I know this album, but it has some good trance mixes of classical songs. Many of you will know Tiesto - Adagio for Strings. I don't like it that much, and critics will find it cheesy. The main dramatic motif is extracted from the original classical song, and is repeated and many times with only production to build tension. Geert has treated Death of Aase more genuinely. The initial motif changes key for a more genuine build and release of tension. Geert has worked with Tiesto before, and that's perhaps the inspiration for Tiesto - Adagio for Strings. I had also tried putting Death of Aase near the end of my Touhou 2 mix, but it didn't fit. So it's nice to use this song finally.

Chicane don't give up. This was posted in the classic trance discord while people were trying to figure out examples of cheese. I listened to most songs in their discussion, and the song rang a bell. I probably listened to it on radio. 

Paul Van Dyk nothing but you. I know "Nothing but You" since the Cirrus remix was in Need for Speed Underground 2, which I played. And I was trying to find higher quality versions of the song not from game rip.

Darude feel the beat. This was another example posted about trying to discuss cheese. Again, I've probably heard this somewhere before.

Ayumi Hamasaki m. I know the song since it was on the Trance subreddit [Hall of Fame](https://old.reddit.com/r/trance/wiki/halloffame). These are tracks that can't be posted on the sub since they're too popular. This is one of the only Japanese-related track on the Hall of Fame so I listened to it and it was good.

so one day I was having a walk and Way Out West - Killa was in my head, and when I listened on Spotify afterwards, system F - Insolation came on afterwards and I liked it a lot. This goes to show that Spotify music recommendations are good. I had a look at the system F Out of the Blue album, including the song Out of the Blue. I can see why Out of the Blue is a classic, but the Motif is a bit annoying and I still like Insolation better.


### Editing
Each song was trimmed to about 7 mins max to be fair to other songs.

Don't give up is good, but there's some issues with it. The imaging is narrow, but the music is panned slightly right and the vocals slightly to its left. You can balance everything slightly leftwards, but the panning of the vocals changes over the song. So you need to use ML to separate the vocals, then treat them separately to the music. Which is what I did. The music and vocals were widened after centering the panning. I also used Adobe Audition 3 spectral pan view to confirm the panning of the vocals changes between the verse and the chorus. This is prolly 1 of the only times that I've used the old version of Adobe Audition in a few years.

During the breakdown, I didn't like the bass, and I already deleted the bass stem from the DEMUCS separation and didn't want to use more space, so I just use a hipass to remove some of the bass.

Darude feel the beat. Surprisingly even after a breakdown with a different tempo, most of the song stays on a whole number of beats. I guess he realized it's useful for a song to stay like that to make it easier to include in a mix. To make it stay on a whole number of bars, you just need to delete 1 beat in the breakdown. I also removed more content in the breakdown so that there's only 1 Drop in breakdown.

Ayumi Hamasaki m. it felt weird for there to be more vocals in the outro after most vocals have finished, so I deleted that part.

Nothing but you. The interesting thing to note about nothing but you is the key. If we assume that that's in D# major and look at the 2nd note in the 5th chord, it's actually flattened, and therefore it's in G# mixolydian. It's more obvious in the Cirrus remix since immediately in the 2nd & 3rd, bar the 7th note in the scale is flattened. But for Simplicity and mixing purposes, you can assume it's still D# major since that's the tonal Center. The width of the bass reduced, and overall width was reduced due to anti-phase in the bridge.

While reducing that bass of Nothing by you, I then invertently applied it to other songs as well, so I moved it to a Take FX.

Insolation is good, but it's a bit slow. Luckily, Ferry Corsten did a remix of his own track, and it's more trance-like and faster at 136 BPM. So I can use this in my mix. Insolation provides a much-needed decrease in the energy for the final track in my cheese mix rather than ending on M. Insolation was shortened from 10m down to 7 to make it fair in length compared to other tracks, and to remove a grating synth I didn't like. 

Insolation's ending was shortened & edited to make it more interesting with the tone synth occuring more often. Also, it was faded out gradually over about 15 seconds. But since it's now made of multiple clips, I need to do it manually via clip envelopes, which is tricky. Insolation has some anti-phase in the breakdown, so I use so I reduce the stereo with of the song by 1 DB. I also noticed the bass was a bit wide on my bassy earbuds, so that was replaced with a multi-band imager.


### Mixing

I did something slightly different for this mix. I was reminded of [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/ijwho1/harmonic_mixingmixing_in_key_isnt_the_norm_is/g3h05i8/) about the EQ/bass swap technique. Also see [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/ijtaw7/eq_mixing_versus_fader_only_mixing/) . So usually when I mix, making and deciding on transitions would take long time and I might have different track lanes with a hipass on so I can move songs there for the transitions. what's different this time is that I also have a low-pass lane as an additional option, so there's no clashing of frequencies, and for smoother transitions. Initially I had the low-pass set to of 250hz, which is my default for EQ when mixing. But then I raised it to 500 hz so a bit more of the other song can Be heard.

I did some basic transitions to start, and some of them sounded okay, so I'll just go with it. But the length of my mix has decreased a fair amount, due to songs overlapping into each other. I revised the transitions in Reverse. The Death of Aase is probably the hardest song to transition since it's short, melodic, and doesn't have many different sections.

The mode was Elastique Efficient 2, and that works OK for most songs. But I was listening to my mix on my phone and Don't Give Up sounded slightly bad, so I might need to change it to Elastique Pro 2.


At one point, I set the BPM to 137 to lengthen the mix after some transitions made shorter. But then I set the BPM higher to 138 to shorten the mix, since I don't want it to be longer than my key mix.

I was about to Upload on hearthis.at, I noticed that they had new restrictions of max 50 songs (which I've exceeded) so I'm unable to upload my mix. HTA has been slowly bringing down limits over the years, I think it was unlimited uploads at the start but the limited to mp3. Then they had weekly limit s going down from 700mb/week doen to 400mb/week, and now that they have something which is unusable for me.

I was listening to my mix on mixcloud and checking all the transitions, amd the song info updated in time so my RPR script works well. I noticed that transition going to Insolation was too wide, so I went through all my transitions in RPR to make sure that they had some effects as the songs.

Listening to the start of my mix, I now notice that opening percussion is too wide so I narrow it.



During the last hours of submission, I was doing some more volume tweaks to make it consistent, but I was having trouble with M. I realised the vocals are too quiet, so I considered a variety of approaches that avoided ML, like voicetrap and spectral upwards expansion, but neither sounded great. After the deadline was over, I settled on a EQ boost in the midrange.

## script get item start timecodes

This was the first time that I included timecodes for my tracklist. I've been wanting to do it for a while, but I wanted to write a script since doing it manually would be tedious. It took some hours to write the script. I was getting a lot of errors initially since my approach is to write the whole script first then test it. You need to check for errors since clips and takes may not have audio.

After a few hours of programming I thought I had something that should work, but the it was either making errors or no results. I've been realised I have old code that I had which checks for muted clips, the logic is not suitable for my current use, so I changed it and my script worked. From then on, writing the script was more productive.

the data structure I chose to store songs and times was a dictionary, since it seemed most logical. But modifying things once in the dictionary is hard. So it's easier for any processing and corrections to happen at the source, when data is added to the dictionary. To prevent duplicate songs, the earliest time code that the song occurs in is prioritized. So this would mean the timecode of the song would usually be at a transition, which is contrary to the convention of time codes to be after transition. But I get to showcase by transitions weather they're good or bad.


### Cheese cover art

After I saw UnbuiltAura9832 working on their cheese cover art, I Was motivated to do the same. The initial concept that I had in a mind was a piece of Swiss cheese with holes, served on a CD and perhaps with a nice and fork on the sides and a mouse.

I went through Microsoft Office clipart, but the aesthetics and selection weren't that great. So I also went to the openclipart website. Finding a Compact Disc apart which is flat and oval instead of circle was a bit hard, so inspired by clip previews of 2 clipart that were similar but 1 was oval, I just downloaded the circle version and flattened it to make it Oval.

I also tried to find the most clipart-genic cheese clipart. Unfortunately, openclipart's a bit slow so I didn't bother going through more than the first few pages of results for cheese. There was one, but it was at very oblique angle. So I used the shear transformation in Illustrator to make it less oblique. Unfortunately you can't have it from fully side on, otherwise it looks too strange, but at least it looks a bit better now. so that final art is perhaps a bit simpler in my initial idea which is just cheese on a desk now, but at least it's simple and Gets the message across.

### Feedback
Good mixing & transitions. Track 3 perhaps dropped the energy a bit, although it's better to lose energy earlier on than later. OMUDJ thought it could be louder.  Most people recognized some tunes, but wished it could be longer. Overall, they enjoyed listening to it.
