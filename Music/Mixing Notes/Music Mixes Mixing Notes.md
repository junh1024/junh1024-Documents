# Music Mixes Mixing Notes

## Introduction
Most of these are available on my [junh1024 YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGqlhiQ9Eu-zsIdK_NRecdQ)

## Racing Mixes
Originally I thought to have separate TDU & NFS series for a brief while, but decided to combine them. I opened separate projects for TDU & NFS importing. I did combined imports for each series, split them off into their own projects, then moved songs between each as necessary. As Charlie https://blog.chiariglione.org/a-future-without-mpeg/ quoted from the 3 kingdoms, " things divided for a long time shall unite, things united for a long time shall divide", only this was a much shorter period. As with the Touhou series, I had a problem of running 2 different styles of mixes in the same series, I opted for the same odd-even approach. Odd number = slow/rock songs, Even = fast/electronic songs. So I re-numbered the TDU & NFS mixes.

## Racing 1
Ra1 has a problem with tempo. preston love, carbon kidd, back again are key compatible, but not bpm compatible. So joining one song implies discarding another.

## Racing 2
It must start with "And I'm hip", since it's iconic & that's how the playlist is sorted in TDU & f2k. It can end in any way. I thought I was lucky since most of the songs I liked are key compatible, but most of the joins sound crap. 

## Racing 3
I grouped a few songs by key progression. I needed more so I may've had the idea to get some DIRT2 songs. I stuck In The Hospital at the start. The transition to Kimosabe sounds really good, even though they're in quite different genres. To go from SoL (Cm) to BB (Dm), you need a Gm. I fuond a Gm in ILS space next level from another project (in reserve, aka songs I dont like that much, but i'm keeping since it might come in handy which it did). The People That We Love is at the end. Initially, I also had One Little Victory after TPTWL, but it would sound a bit awkward since OLV could also be a OP song, even though the mix is a bit short @23m.

## Racing 4
Originally dubbed my Juiced mix, but I had to bring in some songs from TD due to keys. But the 1st 2 xsitions sound v good. I have Syn & FICH. But I need a Dm to join Gm & Am. Turns out it's a bit hard to find electronic songs in Dm. I searched my folders. I found "move your body", which is in Dm. Also, it's in Rock Band so I can still keep this mix 100% VGM, but no longer 100% racing. With that, the mix is now 33'30. Some cutting to do. I'm trying to cut down Passion to remove that synth I dislike. I was deciding whether to use an instro of MYB or not, since I was reading about intensity & it's apparently good to have a low-intensity song somewhere to give the audience a break. But I decided not to since it'd be awkward as I'd need to add MIDI melody to fill in the verse & it's be less recognizable.

## Racing 5
This is my scraps project.

## Racing 6
NFS Electronic project. It must start with Glitterball since it's a great OP & also a beginning of a segment in my playlist. I originally had GB>NBY>WOY, but sounds a bit crap due to using 3rds (G#>D#>F#m). I found a Dubhead (also in reserve) fit better, so now it goes G# C# F#. I used delay to repeat the vox of GB when the transition ends so that it's not so sudden. Dubhead has strong bass, so I skipped the start of "Wonders of you" so that WOY begins with stronger bass. WOY has a few small EQ problems, there's a dip in the mids, so I boost it to make the vox clearer, and a small HF boost too. "Rocket ride soulwax remix" was 3m in NFS8, it's a bit short for this mix since I like the song, so I get the 'album ver' of RR, which is longer, but released about 13y later. RR also has a few problems. It's a bit unbalanced and the vox is to the left. So I upscaled it to 3ch and panned it slightly right. The kick is also too loud. I want a cheap way to turn the kick down w/o affecting the bass unlike EQ. So I settled on reaXcomp MB comp. I also wanted to turn down the HHs in the intro, but I can't do that w/o also affecting the HHs at the end. "Born too slow" is too short at <3m. "Under my wheels" is too slow, also, it's slightly pitched up. There is a 8m length "Rush hour" from the album, but I don't like the song that much (mb since the whole song uses only 1 chord, but most other songs use at leasr 2-3 chords). So I just stuck with the game ver at 4'. So the mix is how about 27' long with 5 songs. Now to do some cutting. I don't like the annoying saw noise synth at the end of RR< so I just cut it out. I cut about 1m from the middle of WOY, and from the end of dubhead, each. Now it's 22.5'.

## Racing 8 WR1
Theres a few good trance songs in MBWR , not so many good ones in WR2 & WR1 rock, so that's the focus of this mix. It must start with Addicted2Speed2.wma since that's the 1st in my WR segment & also a great OP. The keys are close, F > G# so I need to use shifts & 3rds to join. Decoding of WMA doesn't seem to be sample accurate since when I press play the beats may or may not be aligned. Also it's LQ 128kps WMA. There's a PS2 ver which prolly uses ADPCM, but it's hard to extract the OST.

The journey to get higher quality versions is a few years.  Longer, if you count the time I've been playing the game & known the music. MBWR was released in 2003 and it got PS2 version. So I got that version and on the disc there are some files called MERC.FAT & MERC.NOB , MERCB.NOB .

Searching online on how to extract those files I came across some posts https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=19495 on the xentax forums. Who also wanted to extract those files (but from WR2) for the same reason - to get higher-quality music.

As opening those files was hard, I also used Psound to scan the PlayStation files. It finds the music, but it misinterprets some mono files as stereo files and so the output is corrupted. I also need to force them to 32k.

Unfortunately as the search resumed a few years later, the xentax forums closed down a few days ago (in Nov 2023). This means a treasure Trove of game formats research has been gone. The owner intended to make an archive of some material available to a successor. There was also an [announcement](https://xentax.richwhitehouse.com/) about a week later saying the rebooted discord community would prefer to help those who put in effort.

I also replied to someone who's looking for trance music suggestions with magic star from MBWR. Another commenter pointed out from the YouTube comments, it is actually by Dibasic, and implies not specifically made for this game (But it was specifically remixed AKA varispeed pitch up and sound SFX removed). "Can you hear me" is also on YT, and comments point out a short version is on MTV Music Generator 3.

It's found on the "maximum ride" release on Deezer. but it seems like those copies are upscaled from LQ mp3. Since I can't find "addicted to speed", I Shazam it and find it's from   [sound inquisition](https://open.spotify.com/album/2YeMc3Gr4akuVgF0F1MS9o) on  Spotify.  But apart from 2 tracks, the album isn't playable. After some brief research on the internet, it seems that for these types of albums. the licensing may have expired.

I remembered a week or two ago, I used the hcs site to search for the music for the MTV music Generator 3 game to no avail. But it has a GameCube version of MBWR, which uses the DSPADPCM codec. Jackoalan [claims](https://gbatemp.net/threads/dspadpcm-dsp-audio-encoding-made-easy.390305/ )  The codec is based on an IEEE-defined ADPCM predictor combined with 8 coefficient-pairs selected via filtered discrete-fourier-transform. The result is 8-byte ADPCM frames with 1-byte header at 4 bits-per-sample. A mono 16-bit PCM stream ends up being ~28.5% the original size in DSPADPCM." This is slightly more than the typical 25% for adpcm since 16 bits is reduced to 4. 

I drag the DSP file into foobar and it plays, since I had installed some plugins earlier. ADPCM traditionally has high noise floor, but perhaps with DFT involvement, the noise is reduced during the fadeouts. I need to be careful to check the Gamecube audio carefully, since it could also be converted from lossy. But it seems lossless, since there are no gaps on quiet sections, unlike the WMA. Usually the audio quality for GameCube games is pretty mediocre since the Gamecube was the console with the weakest processing power at the time. Xbox version might have 128 KPS XMA which is basically WMA. But it turns out the GameCube version saves the day with its medium quality 32khz lossless. There is no GameCube version for World Racing 2, but the music is worse anyway.

 



## DnB 2
I decided to make my own DnB mix (w/ some VGM) after I listened to "Concord Dawn - The Chaos Mix", and finding it weird & unsatisfactory. It's 170bpm, which is slightly slow, but still feels DnB. There's some tricky cutting & stretching in Barrier Break to keep in on-grid, while the song changes bpm. There's some breaks towards the end to represent you need to take more breaks as you get older (aka I couldn't find a better way to do transitions). Some EQ tweaks to make it sound cohesive, and stereo narrowing to make it more pleasant. With commercial DnB i work less hard than 2hu Doujin music to balance bass/EQ, tho there's still some slight work to make it sound consistent
