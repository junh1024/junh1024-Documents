# Anime Mixes Mixing Notes 2024

## Introduction

## Key Mix 2

### Contest

I've been wanting to do a key trance mix for a while, but I didn't know what to expect in terms of content available. So I started collecting songs for my key trance mix in about late 2023 when I started becoming active in the Trance and classic trance communities on Reddit. In May 2024, "Around The World" was announced and you could request a country. I put in Japan, and week later I got it. Perfect. I worked on 2 Key trance mixes simultaneously and I submitted the second one.

The secret identification question was: "What's your favorite video game before 2010?". The codename is intended to be irrelevant to the mix. I put Air, but remixes from Air are actually in my mix, so I later suggested One ~Kagayaku Kisetsu e~ (same staff but pre-Key game) and The Elder Scrolls - Oblivion, but was eventually renamed Final Fantasy by the organizer. But this could be a blessing in disguise, as some listeners picked up on the Japan connection between the mix and Final Fantasy. I've played none of these games BTW. Early nicknames from listeners included "The Japan mix". Judging by candid information, an estimated 25% of mixes were significantly renamed from the original identification key.

### Sourcing

Most of these are unofficial remixes, and Japan doesn't have a fair use clause, so selling unofficial remixes of commercial songs is always going to be an issue. So, most of the songs are un-Shazamable & hard to buy/find, esp outside Japan.

When sourcing tracks, I went through about 50 albums, many of which I got around 2010. Most doujin CDs are vaguely pop-electronic, but not trance. And even if it's trance, it's not the type of Sound I'm looking for, since some of them from the early 2000s sound as if it was produced on a cheap sound module. But there were a few gems. Songs produced >=2007 would likely sound OK from a production POV. I also went through Key Sounds Label remix CDs. OTSU Club Music OTSU Club Music Vol 1-2 were a big help. Later remix CDs like Modification of Key Sounds Label vol 1 to 2 weren't helpful since they had the yucky sound of modern trance with the exception of 1-2 tracks. Also, I'm avoiding songs after 2008 in case this would be for a classic contest.

My mix includes songs from a wide range of years, and there's no way Bedroom-produced trance from 2006 will sound the same as commercially-produced trance from 2018. But I made lots of volume EQ and other tweaks to try and make them sound consistent, including remaking the bass in the last song, but I can only do so much. Selecting VGM songs, particularly from key, means my songs are more likely to have melody and emotion, to support the (coincidental) storytelling.  Also, it's easier telling Stories that exist in the source material, rather than telling stories that don't exist (as per my KC AMV which summarized S1).

### Mixing

On one render there was drop in energy at the start of the transition to "to the same heights" since I had used take FX plugin with PDC on the previous track. I considered turning that into a track plugin instead, but it seems that this glitch disappeared when I added another take FX but 0 PDC.

For my key Mix 1, most of the transitions were already of the overlap type. But for my key mix 2, most transitions were of cut type due to draft. Going from Enishi to "To the same Heights" was too jarring, had to change it to overlap transition which sounded much better. I changed the rest of the transitions to overlap style for consistency, and it was mostly OK. Except for Shoujo no Gensou & Sunbright. So the length of the mix was shortened from 46 minutes to 45 minutes. 

Initially, the loudness of the songs were all over the place since they come from many different albums. Using a combination of targeting -17 LU for the loudest part of the song and checking the post render loudness statistics afterwards, the loudness now is more consistent.

I rendered my mix since it's easier to check the frequency spectrum that way. I found out that the 1st song has cutoff of about 19k. So that prompted me to swap in a better quality file.

Some songs that had too wide bass had the low frequencies narrowed. And celebrate moon remix, the hi-hats are too wide. And also when there are 3 high hats in a row, then it moves from Center left to left back to Center left. It might be a production error.

On Enishi, there were some elements that were too narrow, but some elements would be too wide if I widened the whole song. So I turned up the side channel, and used FFT stereo tool phase limit to turn down the frequencies that would be too wide. Enishi also had multiband distortion to boost the bass. To the same Heights hedonist remix I applied some bass narrowing. Listening on headphones, the image is too wide in places, so I put a slight stereo narrowing.

The last few days were spent on EQ tweaks and checking on headphones and my bassy earbuds. On Tori no uta, I initially had EQ do bass boost and mid cut. I realised later that Too much bass can influence the LUFS statistic, so I use multi-band compressor with instant time constants to act as distortion to increase the bass without increasing the LUFS. On watery colour, I heard too much bass on my earbuds. So I use some multi band compressor but with long term time constants to act as a bass leveler, so that the powerful kick is turned down, but leaving the bass in the bridge as is.

First impression I noticed there was too much high frequencies on my headphones and it varies through the mix, so I used multiband compression to turn them down.

After the contest, I was listening to my mix on my bassy earbuds and clear headphones, reducing the bass & treble to make it more comfortable on those devices. Implementing those is a hack (using clip FX) and I need to be consistent across multiple clips including during the transitions. Rendering a file and subtracting that from the previous version to confirm that I have applied it to the right sections was helpful and important. I also noticed for many, the hi-hat or cymbals were a bit off-balance, so I reduced the width of high frequencies on the master - more consistent than clip FX.

### Editing

Quite a few of the songs in my key mix 2 use pitch shift at the end to stay in key for the transitions. Listening to my mix, some outros can be shorter to improve the flow & energy consistency. The last transition I used ReaFIR to remove the tones to make the song less repetitive going out of the transition.

This was near the end of my mixing process. This is the 1st time I implemented DPL in a mix, but the 2nd time I considered it. There's several times that the phasing effect is applied to bird poem, but if I applied stereo field rotation during vocals, they would also move, likely making it distracting. Stem separation can get around this, but would increase complexity & dependencies. So I decided to apply it on instrumental sections, which is 2ce during the song. Also, the stereo width of the audio needed to be reduced to make the effect more noticeable. So the V2 of stereo field plugin that I made earlier with some adaptations for this use-case were useful.

The start of Sunbright remix changes pitch a bit and it was hard to fix since getting the right pitch is hard. I even used a Celemony Capstan to analyze the global pitch, but porting over that curve to reaper is a completely manual task.

Sunlight has a motif in the post-chorus. Most of the phrases start about 1/16 off, and I thought it was a bit weird. So I considered using stem separation to get that out, and shift it so the phrases start on the beat. But I thought it might be too difficult to separate, so I just got used to the offbeat phrasing.

For First Impression, the original had out-of-key and vague bass so it needs to be re-produced. I replaced the bass with a saw synth. And so I've inadvertently turned it into Electro Trouse. I've also tried putting some multi-band distortion on the original kick, and my new bass synth. But it turned out to be too much. I also experimented with using a square wave bass but it didn't sound harmonic enough.

### Pitch shift

Selecting the pitch shifters on this mix is important. I had also set the whole mix to Elastique 2 efficient, but that makes some vocal artefacts on Sunbright (Remix), so I change it to Elastique 2 Pro. 

I also tried Elastique 2 Pro for the whole song, but I notice that on the girl's illusions it produced double kicks. So I changed it to Elastique 2 efficient. As this is a long mix, I want to set the default to efficient so that less CPU is used, so that it renders faster but the specific mode matters for a few tracks. So I set the default to efficient. Pro is used for tracks that matter, and for songs I feel need a bass boost.


### About songs

I notice for a lot of Trance songs is there's and long introduction and build up to a breakdown in the middle. For a Key trance song, that might be piano Motif.

- **Tori no Uta** is from the famous Euphoric Tears Doujin CD. It's OK and it sounds like classic trance, but if you use more songs from the same CD gets of it same-y and boring.
- **Watery Color** & First Impression is one of those songs that I found from my doujin album collection as I was going through it. Interesting thing about watery color is that it has breakbeat after the breakdown. Also, every 4th snare is truncated, perhaps due to the kick that comes afterwards. Interesting thing about the original theme of "The Other Side of a Smile", is the slightly uncommon chromatic chord progression of 4 3 2# 2. It could also be analyzed as 4 3 1M 6. The arrangement is quite clever while still being fairly faithful to the original. Going to watery colour, sometimes it sounds as if the song is speeding up, but everything's still constant Tempo.
- **Enishi Celebrate Moon remix** is from the Violet album by XL project. It seems to be a pair of albums with Claire being the lighter side of EDM in house, and Violet being the more intense trance. I appreciated Claire more initially since it's house, and didn't like Violet. But there's a few good songs on there. In the chorus, apart from your usual bass, chords, and ostinatos, we have the delay piano and the supersaw lead playing melodies. So this means polyphony.
- **To the Same Heights (Hedonist Remix)** I found since it was on the same album as a just one magic word remix. I found that song since I was searching on YouTube for just one magic word remixes. Nothing really stands out or lacking. Just solid production.
- **Shoujo no Gensou | ZTS remix** was originally released on the CLANNAD 2007 OPED single. It seems like key commissions ZTS remixes every now & then, so as a result, his key remixes are spread many different releases. It's a bit mediocre and 10m long, but if you want to make a trance mix then it's there. ZTS's style has basically not changed since 2004. Rather than any specific story or message, the lyrics and the song paint images and feelings. When you transition into a new song, there's often a loss of energy so it's important for the new song to build up the energy quickly at the start with things like embellishments and sound effects. Which this song does well, and was helpful for my mix.
- **Sunbright (Brightest Sunflowers Remix)** - has 4536 & circle progressions, very Japan-ish. It's also is one of the only post-2012 key EDM remixes that I like, from listening to the key 20th anniversary box set. Note that the 2nd chorus has breakbeat. Immediately from the first verse, you can tell that the girl is a tsundere. Even though the words are split across syllable boundaries, Kitazawa sings them so effortlessly. You can hear the amount of effort in the production of the song since there's so much detail. Like the added reverb on every fourth snare hit, but only in the pre-chorus. The unconventional hi-hat rhythm, and turning the outro lyrics into a bridge.
- **First Impression**: the song is the very first song on the Kanon soundtrack, but when you hear it it's uplifting and you know that it goes right at the end. The song has the spirit of Trance since it has supersaws. But house characteristics since it's 130 BPM. So I would call it trouse. Spotify has over 800 genres so maybe this is one of them. 



### Themes

So I notice that there's some sad songs near the end of my mix 1. I asked gpt 3.5 turbo if there were any themes of depression in key games, and it said that depression and mental health themes are explored in Clannad and Little Busters. I would have thought that more would have that theme, but perhaps the concept of looking for is Sadness. Recently completing my key visual novels document, I realized that my mix 1 roughly follows the "key formula". Romantic middle, then a tragic separation, finally an emotional reunion. And so, the songs in my mix 1 & 2 play The Following roles:

- Beginning: Bird Poem*, Watery Color
- Romance: Enishi, To The Same Heights
- Sadness: The Girl'S Illusions*
- Climax/Ending: Sunbright*, First Impression

Vocal* songs highlight key story points. Although the proportions for my key mix 2 are a bit off. 

Although it could be said that for some of the sad songs the mood is more like introspection rather than Sadness. I don't think it tells any specific story with specific plot points, but you could probably make up something. But more like a general journey typical of key games.

### Feedback
[From reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/1dcp9sy/may_2024_mix_competition_trance_around_the_world/l7zlwqs/). Transitions and flow were good. Although no-one knew the tunes, they enjoyed them for most part. Using classic doujin trouse (done on a low budget), gave some songs an "old-school" sound, which appealed to some people. As usual, most people wanted it to be longer.

For my mix, I used VGM remix so they already have some nice melodies, which people noted. The placement of the songs and good transitions helped with the flow, and I believe the key changes at every transition helped with the storytelling. Going tr 1>2 and 5>6, from minor to major, you can almost immediately feel the warmth.
