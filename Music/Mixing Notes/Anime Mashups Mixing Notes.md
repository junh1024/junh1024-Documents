# Anime Mashups Mixing Notes

## Lucky Star-Katamari Exotica

During July 2020, I was listening to the Lucky Star Remix albums. The Glucosa mix stands out as being different since it barely resembles the original Motekke Sailor Fuku, no-one sings the melody. Rather, there's some voice clips over some mellow lo-fi beats. I was also listening to some Katamari albums, collecting songs for my electro, house, and dance/909 mixes. I wake up one morning with a song in my head. It's Katamari, and maybe it's cosmic lounge, maybe something from novita. I search up cosmic & lounge, nope, wrong song, but it is on novita. It's Katamari Exotica. Maybe the next day I realise it would go well under Lucky Star voice clips. I was wanting to avoid using ML for this, I had in mind Kagami's discussing about the grocery store in ep17, but that's not a lot of talk, and not very interesting/expressive as the acting on Glucosa mix so ML it is. Also, Glucosa is chill at x bpm, but Exotica is fast at 14 bpm, so I had to do a compromise bpm to try to keep the chill feeling while not too many artefacts. Also, I did some variable stretching at the start to have sections start on 8-bar edges for easier cutting.

## Irony-BDD
Original finished Aug '17-ish. There was feedback in the past about how it was out of key at times. I revised it shortly after, but pitchshifting sounded awkward. My Nexus-Mutsuki mashup didn't do so well on r/Oreimo, but there was a positive comment which encouraged me to revisit this for a post. I finished replicating the pitch shifts for the rest of the song & infrastructure upgrades. I was about to call it finished, but then I realized it missing a bit of contrast due to the missing bridge. I cautiously extended the song.

The vox needs some shifting to appear in key for the instro bridge. But it might be a 5th out. Copying a technique from my SOMH-Haruna mashup, I make another track for a few small sections that need zplane retune. The instro is shortened at the final chorus & ending to avoid boring repetition. The ending chords are off key, so I shift them, but only some of them, again, to create variety & avoid much repetition. There is a pre-final-chorus bit that I could fill in w/vox since I filled that part earlier in the song, but I feel it could use a break in energy.

## Prism Sympathy - Perfect Area Complete
I revisit this in 2021 to fix some things. The project is too slow so the instro has shifting artefacts. I make it a bit faster, but still audible. I also replace the infrastructure with my own tools & make the instro wider for more surround activity. Some bit loop obviously to keep the timing so I make some changes to make it less obvious. Ther is a break near the end so Musically, it would make sense to raise the key. But production-wise, would be bad due to pitching & quality reasons.

## Perfect Area Complete-Hanayamata
I had to check whether I had duplicated the aca/instro on another mashup since I want to avoid doing so, and I recall using  of these songs in a previous mashup (*see above), which I wanted to revise. I haven't., so this mashup can go ahead. PAC centers around tonic/dominant chords in the verse, but HOI centers around mediants. So I need to chop the HOI instro and make a loop which starts with a tonic so that it sounds OK. HOI ends a bit abruptly so I add a reverb to the end to keep the energy going for a bit. There is a MV for this, so I tried to keep the aca as uncut as possible. The ending was long, so I cut it short. During the instrumental breaks, there is a drop in energy so I constructed a "...HAI...HAI....NEVER EVER GIVE UP,...HAI...HAI....NEVER GIVE UP" loop which didn't really exist in the original. I had to loop a piano clip for the bridge. There was some bass around the edges of the loop so I was inspired by the loop , which had a hipass, to hipass it further to reduce the bass. Overall, about 60 cuts needed to assemble this mashup.

## Aru-Money
I got this mashup idea when listening to the Aru character song. But I know there will need to be some editing done to Abba money because money is completely in minor but Aru switches between major and minor. There are multiple cover MTs of money from jamkazam and Deezer. But both of them have a non-constant BPM so I can't really use them. I have to resort to MIDI. The verses have note-level editing to make the instruments in money to fit better with the major verses of Aru. Some instruments were muted globally. The chorus of money was shortened to match Aru. Money has a pre-chorus but not really a bridge. Aru has a bridge but money doesn't. So the pre-chorus of money was used for the bridge in Aru. I was spending and procrastinating time on tweaking the MIDI verse of money and it was close to the submission date so I decided to hurry up an copy the MIDI data to fill in the verses and the choruses. I need to edit the MIDI in the chorus since my bass guitar VSTi doesn't support pitch bend. I noticed that the introduction is a bit low-energy and there are some lines at the end so I moved them to the intro. I mute some clips to add variety and match the power of the Aru. I adjust the tune parameter of MDA piano to make it sound like a honkey-tonk piano but it's not quite the same. I delete the 3rd verse since overall it's a bit repetitive & 3rd verse has some instro leakage.
