# Drum and Bass Mixes Mixing Notes

## Introduction
Most of these are available on my [junh1024 YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGqlhiQ9Eu-zsIdK_NRecdQ)


## DnB 2
I decided to make my own DnB mix (w/ some VGM) after I listened to "Concord Dawn - The Chaos Mix", and finding it weird & unsatisfactory. It's 170bpm, which is slightly slow, but still feels DnB. There's some tricky cutting & stretching in Barrier Break to keep in on-grid, while the song changes bpm. There's some breaks towards the end to represent you need to take more breaks as you get older (aka I couldn't find a better way to do transitions). Some EQ tweaks to make it sound cohesive, and stereo narrowing to make it more pleasant. With commercial DnB i work less hard than 2hu Doujin music to balance bass/EQ, tho there's still some slight work to make it sound consistent
