# Drum and Bass Mixes Mixing Notes

## Introduction
Most of these are available on my [junh1024 YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGqlhiQ9Eu-zsIdK_NRecdQ)


## Drum and Bass Mix 2
I decided to make my own DnB mix (w/ some VGM) after I listened to "Concord Dawn - The Chaos Mix", and finding it weird & unsatisfactory. It's 170bpm, which is slightly slow, but still feels DnB. There's some tricky cutting & stretching in Barrier Break to keep in on-grid, while the song changes bpm. There's some breaks towards the end to represent you need to take more breaks as you get older (aka I couldn't find a better way to do transitions). Some EQ tweaks to make it sound cohesive, and stereo narrowing to make it more pleasant. With commercial DnB i work less hard than 2hu Doujin music to balance bass/EQ, tho there's still some slight work to make it sound consistent

## Drum and Bass Mix 6

Before we proceed further, let's look at the tracklist:

1. 00:00 Concord Dawn ft Optiv - Zulu
1. 06:47 Concord Dawn ft Scribe - Get Ready
1. 12:26 Concord Dawn ft Tiki - Don't Tell Me
1. 18:28 Concord Dawn - Horror Show
1. 24:29 Concord Dawn - Scimitar

### What's in a name?

So the secret identification question is: What Is Your Favorite Halloween Candy? I put in Wafer. A Wafer breaks easily and it alludes to the fact my mix is a Drum and Bass AKA Beakbeat mix. Other people remarked they might have the same answer as last year. If you put in the same answer, then mix names wouldn't be unique. For this reason, It's likely that soccer decided to have a completely new theme for mix names, which is Harry Potter/Wizarding World poisonus consumables, so the percentage that got renamed is 100%.

Maybe my mix could be called the Jawdrop mix since cdub said something about his jaw dropping, but no Jawdrop spell or potion yet exists in the Wizarding World AFAIK.

Since I've done a few DnB mixes already, the obvious number to put would be 6, like the Halloween themed ASOT666.

### Concept

Last year, I thought your mix had to be trance since it was a trance sub, but there was no rule for this. The few people that did submit non-trance definitely stood out in 2023. Like the [Tech House AKA Kit-kat mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TinaXpYLso) and [Ambient Sour Patch Kids](https://soundcloud.com/soccernamlak/the-sour-patch-kids-mix) , the latter which won.

[Most comments](https://old.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/17l6psp/october_2023_mix_competition_listening_and_voting/k7c6alp/) said last Halloween contest that my Tohou Mix 6 [Toffee](https://soundcloud.com/soccernamlak/the-toffee-mix) wasn't spooky at all. I had an idea in Dec 2023. Looking at my Dnb Mix 2 and the songs I didn't use, the leftovers could form a mix.

Going through the songs, a narrative can be constructed. The night is young ("Zulu") and they are to "Get Ready" for a Halloween event, but there is some disagreement over what to wear ("Don't Tell Me"). They finally the go to the "Horror Show", and it gets quite scary "Scimitar".


### Is it scary?
(But not the MJ song)
u/SamVortigaunt wanted single producer mixes that were scary. The people have spoken, and they didn't think mine wasn't wholly scary, so it doesn't fulfill your brief. Maybe I should've use AI to remove the vocals to make it more relevant.

You'd think a album of songs with a hairy scary bat [on the cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/Concorddawn03.jpg) would be wholly relevant to a Halloween contest in 2024, but Concord Dawn never said that, partly since they could not have known about something that would happen 21 years later.

### Other conversation
When [I said](https://old.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/1gjui9w/october_2024_mix_competition_the_evil_dead/lz0vn8k/) I didn't like DnB this hard it's true - except for Zulu, I don't like the dissonant sound.

E: also read that DJ Optiv died a few years ago (featured in tr1), rib Optiv. Also, Concord Dawn is retiring.


### About songs

DJ freeform on Discogs [said](https://www.discogs.com/master/145004-Concord-Dawn-Uprising) "Horror Show is quite simply one of the most stunning pieces of electronic music ever produced. Even Dillinja himself has not ever bettered this track."

The use of different synths during the breakdown, the lead synth over the ostinato creates polyphony. There might be something around angular chord progressions, harmonic/melodic minor, or modal scale.

## Mixing

Get Ready, Don't Tell Me, Horror Show, Scimitar were joined in Dec 2023. The order is influenced by key and gets more intense towards the end. 1st transition: the sense of tonic & root is so weak that a semitone down isn't noticeable.

In August 2024 revisiting this nearing Halloween and looking through the project, I can put Zulu at the start of the mix. I would have wanted Zulu to end a mix since it's at the end of Uprising, but there's not much else I can do to extend the mix. I don't really like Morning light and Raining Blood so I'm not putting those in.

With the added song, the mix is now almost 30 minutes. The Halloween 2024 contest has a soft limit of 45 so if I add in a half of my DNB mix 9 it would total 53 minutes, which wouldn't qualify. At 172 BPM, my mix is 29 minutes. 6% 5 = 1, setting for BPM to 171 makes my mix 30 minutes and 1 second bracket after some trimming At the start.

Despite being from the same album, they required some individual EQ adjustment

- Get Ready: Bass +1db, Highs +2.5dB
- Don't Tell Me: Bass -2.5db, Highs -2.5dB (bass quite hard-hitting & highs too harsh)
- Horror Show: Mids +2.5dB
- Scimitar: Bass distortion to make bass audible on smaller speakers

The last song just ended so I add in a delay fade out to slightly extend it.

DPL could be used for the breakdown in Horror Show, but I didn't add it since I don't really like my mix (unlike Key Trance 2 & Racing 7) and lack of people having surround speakers.
