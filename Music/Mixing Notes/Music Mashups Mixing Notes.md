# Music Mashups Mixing Notes

## Never Give Up on the Good Times-Nexus

So, I had the idea for NGU-Nexus when I was listening to a cover of NGU, and noticed the chords sounded like 4536, It would go well with Osanpo biyori instro, except I had already used it with Nexus aca. So I need to use it with the Nexus instro. I tried shuffling the chords in Nexus, originally 3456 to 4536. But the original 3456 sounded more natural due to piano & etc fill. I originally had the proj @ 120bpm since the vox was at 117. But due to stretching & a pitch shift of the vox at the end of +2st, and the fast speed of the original instro, it would sound bad, so I raised it to 128. I thought about using Mai Kotone's Renai Circulation House cover, and the speed matches a bit better, but the minimal instrumentation and spectrum conflicted with NGU, so I reverted back to Nexus. I set the bpm to 124 and made the vox go only up by 1st at the end to reduce speed issues. Elastique VST2 now works, but I'm hesitant to use it in a project . I used MIDI to recreate the flute from never give up into a synth for the mashup.

This is also the 1st project that has FFTMT sustain control used from the start, but FFTMT Noise/GF works better.

There was an instro available of NGU sometime, but the instro differs at the end so I need to use ML-derived vox. During the bridge, ML results aren't great so I need to chop & replace looped lyrics to sound OK. In June 2022, I tried more MLs since they were available to me. Demucs3 does a better job than MDX B on this song. And I undid some of the hax due to bad ML.

## My Life Goes Shalala Lala
This mashup was for a contest. The theme was "A different kind of love song". AKA a love song paired with a completely different song. I had a few pairings w/Japanese songs, but they weren't really love songs, or the contrast wasn't great enough. I then had the idea of using Billy Joel - My Life & Vengaboys - Shalala lala. Wikipedia says Joel was inspired by the Walker's original Shalala lala version. And some youtube videos noted the similarity between the 2 songs, but the mashup has apparently not been done before.

The song has a weird structure with two bridges. In my first draft, I cut out a chorus to Shorten my mashup, since I thought it wasn't very interesting. In my second draft, I thought of restructuring My Life so it's more like a usual song, to retain listener interest. I have the verse, then the bridge as a pre-chorus, and then the chorus. I remove gaps between these so that it flows better. The gap before the second verse is retained, but slightly shorter to match the length of the instrumental break. My mashup is now better and more usual. It ends just after the second chorus. After listening on my phone, I realise this is too abrupt so I add in some content from the introduction. Overall, this is a mashup that works but I don't really like due to the instrumental song.


## Cold Heart

My initial idea was song from a 1969 drama-musical film that uses the circle progression as an instrumental, and pair that up with an Anzen Chitai song that also has the circle progression. But although the 5.1 surround to mix from the movie does have separation, it's very vocal-heavy. Karaoke covers also don't sound great. So I chose another idea.

Michael Jackson rock with you & Elton John sacrifice. I know of the song from another mashup. I used the PNAU remix of sacrifice aka coldheart since there are backup vocals in the chorus as a guide for the song structure, since I don't know that song well. I have the multitrack of rock with you and I could make a surround mashup if I have that as an instrumental. But it's not finished. So I render a mp3 proxy that has the same loudness and timing.

Cold heart has a weird 3-part song structure. Verse, Chorus, and post-chorus. I originally looped the chorus of rock with you to cover the Chorus, and post-chorus of cold heart. But the bridge of Rock With You Came after the second chorus which sounded good when covered the post-chorus of cold heart. So I replicated this edit to the earlier part of my mashup. Overall, the mashup for works but I think it's a bit boring. I could bring in some backup vocals from rock with you but cold heart thickens at the final chorus so it'll be too busy.

Originally, I had the instrumental break from Rock With You with the synth flute cover the final chorus of cold heart. But the mashup sounded better if I had the instrumental break cover twice of the final chorus of cold heart. I made a cold ending for rock with you so I also shortened the introduction. But the shortened introduction didn't sound good, so I reverted to the full-length introduction.

Elton John mentioned in the video that PNAU were given the tapes to his songs and they could do anything. So that means no new vocals were recorded for this remix. The vox in cold heart were probably stretched, so to maintain maximum quality, I should not stretch them further. The master Tempo should be of cold heart, and that means stretching Rock With You. This mashup has now come full circle, because PNAU made a new instrumental for the old songs of cold heart, and my mashup replaces that instrumental with older songs.

I heard cold heart used before in a mashup but as an instrumental. It was a big hit 2 years ago. I hope people aren't sick of the song. 

I was having vocal balance issues on this mashup even after EQ tweaks. At one time I accidentally bumped up the instrumental to 5db. And then it sounded perfect. When I finished my project I confirmed with a loudness meter on my instrumental & vocal tracks separately. And I found that the LUFS on the first chorus is very close, so that means they're balanced.
