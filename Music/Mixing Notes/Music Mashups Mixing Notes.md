# Music Mashups Mixing Notes

## That's the way-Spellbound

That's the way I like it. The instrumental Grant Nelson - Spellbound is actually a remix of Bas Noir - [My Love Is Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvUd4f50wzQ) from 1988. Although my mashup is short & there are several edits of the song, I need the full 7 min version due to having the required arrangement & variations for my mashup.

There is a story behind how I know this song. Around 2010, I was listening to a house radio station. The song came on but I don't know it. So I  recorded it with a Olympus Voice recorder (This was before the days of Shazam). The voice recorder needed installation of software to access the recordings. I sent a recording to the radio station, but they didn't reply for a while . I phoned the radio station and the DJ said phone again in about a minute. The next phone call I've got the answer.

The vox needed stretching in editing to conform to a constant BPM since that's probably the way the original song was. In 2023 I lengthen the mashup with an intro and outro to make it more house-like. Reverb was also added to the vox, and the vox were turned down. 

## Never Give Up on the Good Times-Nexus

So, I had the idea for NGU-Nexus when I was listening to a cover of NGU, and noticed the chords sounded like 4536, It would go well with Osanpo biyori instro, except I had already used it with Nexus aca. So I need to use it with the Nexus instro. I tried shuffling the chords in Nexus, originally 3456 to 4536. But the original 3456 sounded more natural due to piano & etc fill. I originally had the proj @ 120bpm since the vox was at 117. But due to stretching & a pitch shift of the vox at the end of +2st, and the fast speed of the original instro, it would sound bad, so I raised it to 128. I thought about using Mai Kotone's Renai Circulation House cover, and the speed matches a bit better, but the minimal instrumentation and spectrum conflicted with NGU, so I reverted back to Nexus. I set the bpm to 124 and made the vox go only up by 1st at the end to reduce speed issues. Elastique VST2 now works, but I'm hesitant to use it in a project . I used MIDI to recreate the flute from Never Give Up into a synth for the mashup.

This is also the 1st project that has FFTMT sustain control used from the start, but FFTMT Noise/GF works better.

There was an instro available of NGU sometime, but the instro differs at the end so I need to use ML-derived vox. During the bridge, ML results aren't great so I need to chop & replace looped lyrics to sound OK. In June 2022, I tried more MLs since they were available to me. Demucs3 does a better job than MDX B on this song. And I undid some of the hax due to bad ML.

## My Life Goes Shalala Lala
This mashup was for a contest. The theme was "A different kind of love song". AKA a love song paired with a completely different song. I had a few pairings w/Japanese songs, but they weren't really love songs, or the contrast wasn't great enough. I then had the idea of using Billy Joel - My Life & Vengaboys - Shalala lala. Wikipedia says Joel was inspired by the Walker's original Shalala lala version. And some youtube videos noted the similarity between the 2 songs, but the mashup has apparently not been done before.

The song has a weird structure with two bridges. In my first draft, I cut out a chorus to Shorten my mashup, since I thought it wasn't very interesting. In my second draft, I thought of restructuring My Life so it's more like a usual song, to retain listener interest. I have the verse, then the bridge as a pre-chorus, and then the chorus. I remove gaps between these so that it flows better. The gap before the second verse is retained, but slightly shorter to match the length of the instrumental break. My mashup is now better and more usual. It ends just after the second chorus. After listening on my phone, I realise this is too abrupt so I add in some content from the introduction. Overall, this is a mashup that works but I don't really like due to the instrumental song.

- Idea: 12/2022

- Contest: 7/2/2023 - 14/2/2023
- Finish: /2023

## Cold Heart

My initial idea was song from a 1969 drama-musical film that uses the circle progression as an instrumental, and pair that up with an Anzen Chitai song that also has the circle progression. But although the 5.1 surround to mix from the movie does have separation, it's very vocal-heavy. Karaoke covers also don't sound great. So I chose another idea.

Michael Jackson rock with you & Elton John sacrifice. I know of the song from another mashup. I used the PNAU remix of sacrifice aka coldheart since there are backup vocals in the chorus as a guide for the song structure, since I don't know that song well. I have the multitrack of rock with you and I could make a surround mashup if I have that as an instrumental. But it's not finished. So I render a mp3 proxy that has the same loudness and timing.

Cold heart has a weird 3-part song structure. Verse, Chorus, and post-chorus. I originally looped the chorus of rock with you to cover the Chorus, and post-chorus of cold heart. But the bridge of Rock With You Came after the second chorus which sounded good when covered the post-chorus of cold heart. So I replicated this edit to the earlier part of my mashup. Overall, the mashup for works but I think it's a bit boring. I could bring in some backup vocals from rock with you but cold heart thickens at the final chorus so it'll be too busy.

Originally, I had the instrumental break from Rock With You with the synth flute cover the final chorus of cold heart. But the mashup sounded better if I had the instrumental break cover twice of the final chorus of cold heart. I made a cold ending for rock with you so I also shortened the introduction. But the shortened introduction didn't sound good, so I reverted to the full-length introduction.

Elton John mentioned in the video that PNAU were given the tapes to his songs and they could do anything. So that means no new vocals were recorded for this remix. The vox in cold heart were probably stretched, so to maintain maximum quality, I should not stretch them further. The master Tempo should be of cold heart, and that means stretching Rock With You. This mashup has now come full circle, because PNAU made a new instrumental for the old songs of cold heart, and my mashup replaces that instrumental with older songs.

I heard cold heart used before in a mashup but as an instrumental. It was a big hit 2 years ago. I hope people aren't sick of the song. 

I was having vocal balance issues on this mashup even after EQ tweaks. At one time I accidentally bumped up the instrumental to 5db. And then it sounded perfect. When I finished my project I confirmed with a loudness meter on my instrumental & vocal tracks separately. And I found that the LUFS on the first chorus is very close, so that means they're balanced.

## No one knows-Skyfall
Skyfall is the opening song from the Skyfall movie. The movie is available in surround So I can make a surround mashup. I am remaking [DJ Poulpi's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsEZ1jvjTB0) mashup from YouTube. [Someone else](https://soundcloud.com/johnnymashit/no-one-falls-adele-queens-of-the-stone-age) did another mashup from Soundcloud but their version is unavailable. The BPM of the project is set to 80 which is the simple average of both songs rounded to the nearest integer. The BPM of no one knows is divided by 2. The master arrangement is Skyfall since editing an orchestra song May produce Audible discontinuities. After some basic editing, the songs don't really sync. This means one or both songs are non-constant BPM. I conform Skyfall 2 constants ppm. I had the idea of adding Whispers to the back speakers. After while I realise it's not a mashup that I would like to listen to often. Since it's a bit melancholy.

## No one knows-the last bullet
I have another idea for the contest. The last bullet is in the same key as no one knows. The arrangement is set to the last bullet since I'm more familiar with that song. The lyrics of no one knows 1st verse verses are split over the 1st & 2nd verse of my mashup since the rhyming & theme is similar. The pre-chorus is filled with lyrics from later on in the song. The chorus audio is duplicated three times in my mashup because I'm lazy. The bridge lyrics in my mashup are taken from the ending of no one knows to complement the strings. Overall I don't really like this mashup due to the instrumental. 




## CANDY POP-IDK
Why Candy Pop. After listening to EXID-IDK a few times because I'm evaluating how crap the DA mix was I thought it might go well with Candy Pop. The contest theme is food. A food reference must be in the artist or title. Drink doesn't count. Food-related shows do count. Much of my initial arrangement was done with a ReaFIR faux instrumental. But I can't balance until I have a decent quality instrumental for IDK. I want to use UVR 5 since it has good SQ, and provides 2 stems only, and therefore simplicity. It seems that the dependencies for UVR were updated and I tried some of the fixes like downgrading librosa but there was still a python soundfile error. The model format also seemed to change from version 5 beta to version 5.2. So beta UVR CLI is effectively unusable. So I have to use DEMUCS. This has the advantage I can have stems for a surround version, and better the surround mix on Apple music. On preliminary testing, it had better in separation, but the surround activity is still low, and my like for the song is mediocre, so I disabled it.

After I finished the basic arrangement, my mashup felt a bit boring. Recreating the stutters from the original Candy pop was much needed to bring the energy and excitement. The original source for the stutters might be one beat or 1 bar before, but I settled on particular section and duplicated it throughout my mashup which seemed more effective. There needs to be a balance between obeying the original, or the new flow of a smooth House song. I think sutters without the further breaks (except at the start of the first verse) is enough.

Initially, I had the introduction & Bridge be different for variety, but the bridge didn't sound that great due to artefacts and chords so I made it the same as the introduction and added some drums to both. The start of the bridge is a completely Candy Pop bare rap for contrast and progression reasons. I originally intended to make a full version of my mashup and then cut it down to Skittles length (according to the AMV) for the contest, but the bridge rap adds some needed contrast.

### Parar de Fumar-Agua de Coco

I know of Cyro Baptista - Parar de Fumar from Telefunken live from the lab series. I know Marcos Valle - Aqua de Coco from the Putumayo Brazilian lounge album. I know of that album because I liked the Bossacucanova - Previsao when I heard it at a computer store in the 2000s. I didn't have many implements on me, so I used pastebin to record some information so I could check it at home.

It seems that Cyro has changed the song over the years. Comparing the 2021 live performance to the 2002 CD, he's added coughing in the introduction and a vocal percussion outro.

The contest theme was more cowbell, so either song in the mashup needs to have a cowbell. Parar de Fumar might not have a real cowbell. It could be a woodblock or singular bongo. The originator of the contest allows agogos (made of metal), but thinks wood doesn't count. But the judge is judjing the contest and may allow similar instruments as long as they play the role of cowbell.

Coconut water has sampled drums, so it should be a modern production with constant BPM. Parar de Fumar on Traktor shows an almost integer BPM, but it's actually non-constant BPM. This is on top of the 2 breaks which throw the Beat off for the whole song. The mashup BPM is set to part way between Parar de Fumar & coconut water with a bias towards the instrumental. To conform Parar de Fumar to constant BPM, cutting the song at its different sections, then stretching was mostly enough. 

The song has breaks but it's much more significant than a previous Candy Pop-IDK mashup. The first break was extended by a few beats since I thought it sounded better. 

The mashup arrangement is the original Parar de Fumar. I thought of shortening the mashup, since the last minute is just repeats of the chorus, but has some variation & climax, so I left it.

The center drums from Parar de Fumar were removed, so you can hear the kick & snare from coconut water in line with my original vision in my head. I thought about bringing in some Cyro & Glasso vox from the live version, but decided against it since it would create dependencies, complexity, and the structure might not be allowed for the contest. It may also sound inconsistent as Cyro is almost 20 years older. 

I used loudness meters to measure the loudness of the vocals and instrumental. The vocals were slightly overpowering in the chorus, so I applied some compression. I tried a new compression strategy - fast attack & slow release.

The chords of coconut water are quite simple. It's mostly 2 & 6 with the pre-chorus differing the most. The structure of Parar de Fumar is quite simple. Introduction, Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, outro. No Bridge. It was a mostly straightforward process to fit the structure of coconut water to Parar de Fumar. There are subtle changes in the chords of Parar de Fumar, which signalled that this is the pre-chorus. Since the chords in coconut water are so simple, the change in pre-chorus chords give some much needed variation. Although using pre-chorus chords at the start of the mashup would seemingly fit Parar de Fumar more, it would sound strange basically jumping straight into pre-chorus chords so I left it at the verse chords.

The woodblocks are actually occluding the vocals in the verses, so I removed them for my final version after the contest. I added reverb to the vox to cover artefacts, and ReaFIR to turn down the brass in the pre-chorus. The digital pitch algorithm was changed to Elastique 2 pro instead of Efficient.

Overall, the instrumental chords only half match the vocals, but it sounds ok for most part. 

I reduced the width of the high frequencies slightly for the hi-hats. I also wanted to reduce the width of the vocals. I can't find any free jsfx mid-side compressor so I tried isotope ozone 4 to compress the side Signal. This worked but I was worried the image would be unstable so I used mid-side to reduce the side signal by fixed amount instead. I also noticed on the phase vectorscope that the vox were slightly tilted to the left, so I corrected this with a pan.

Coconut water is at a almost constant dynamic, like house, but Para de Fumar changes throughout the song. I did some LUFS measurements and the last chorus seems louder, so I turned it down by 1dB.

I noticed the vox sounding a bit thin, but didn't do anything about it until now, so on the EQ I replaced the high boost, with a subtle low boost & mid cut. The frequencies were tweaked after analyzing the vox with Audition. The highs were a bit strong on my headphones (1 of 3 ear devices I can check on, they all sound different), so I turn them down by 2.5dB.

### Ode to Ozone


### Early versions

![Ozone 4](https://rekkerd.org/img/articles/izotope_ozone4.jpg)

Back in the day, I used a bit of Ozone 4 (2008) for mixing, since it has a nice suite of tools all in 1 plugin, like EQ, reverb, exciter, and the CPU use is low to boot. Version 4.04 (2011) is the first version to have 64-bit release and therefore the earliest version that will run on most modern DAWs. Only 2 things are missing:
1. The EQ Target curve from version 3 was removed since they claimed it's not a meaningful Target
2. And two that UI is a bit small on Modern screens

![Ozone 5](https://medias.audiofanzine.com/images/normal/izotope-ozone-5-advanced-374874.jpg)

In Ozone 5 (2012), Individual modules as available as separate VSTs in your DAW for reduced CPU use, since the combined modules version takes about 50% more CPU. The architecture was also changed so that if you reinstall your PC, some modules won't function correctly since it also relies on the registry to function. The reverb module was upgraded to a hybrid setup. More filters were added to the EQ including brickwall. Matching EQ is now a lot easier to use & access. It was in 4, but it's quite tricky to use since it also involves adjusting spectrum settings. I've used matching EQ a few times, but usually I just EQ by ear.

Ozone 5 also introduces the ability to change the phase of selected frequencies in digital EQ mode. This is useful if you want to turn a non-linear phase plugin into almost linear phase, by applying a maximum phase adjustment. Since you can't adjust phase without an EQ change, you need to add 2 EQ filters on top of each other, but with opposite amplitudes, so that they cancel each other in gain but you still have phase control. I've not seen many EQs that allow you to control phase independently of gain. Version 6 onwards restricts the phase control to linear/minimum so this trick might not work.


### Later versions

![Ozone 6](https://dt7v1i9vyp3mf.cloudfront.net/styles/news_large/s3/imagelibrary/O/O6_06_15_02-mJak_wEcuLLflhbb_MD5mk3_hpcNKMgT.jpg)

Versions 6 to 8 were a blur with nothing useful to me & I had to consult online documentation & reviews for these (mainly Sound on Sound) since I haven't used past 5 much.

Version 6 (2014) unfortunately removed the reverb and many people lamented the decision. Ozone even wrote the 2013 Edition (and earlier versions) of their [mastering guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20130409151949/http://downloads.izotope.com/guides/iZotopeMasteringGuide_MasteringWithOzone.pdf) saying "Mastering reverb can be used as a way to unify" instruments when they don't sound very cohesive together. As such, 6 was marketed as a creative mastering suite, not a complete one. Version 6 also removes module & global amount sliders. I guess that was 1 of the lesser-used features that they removed. It's also the 1st to expose & enlarge the graph flow into the main interface, and remove the fixed module pages. So now, users need to manually add modules if they wish to use them. Version 6 is also the 1st version available in standalone.

Version 7 (2015) adds some vintage modules (EQ, compressor, limiter, tape). Vintage was all the rage back then, I guess after Taylor Swift's release of 1989 in 2014. Thank god that tape doesn't add wow & flutter, as it's 1 of the things I loathe about analogue, and would also add latency. Version 7 also adds codec preview, which some people applauded, but I would argue it's not that useful since unless you can have the exact encoder & settings as the final encode, the artefacts will be different. Also, general transparency rates are known. Default in LAME MP3 is HQ/slow, but some services may use fast instead. Default AAC encoder for Apple Music would ofc not be Fraunhofer either.

Version 8 (2017) adds Dynamic EQ, not that useful/working for me TBH. Version 8 to 10 also adds spectral shaper & stabilizer which tames frequency problems like resonances, or broad adjustments like oeksound soothe & soundtheory gulfoss respectively.

![Ozone 9](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ETyy4rBCJEYMon2u2uGdYR.jpg)

Version 9 (2019) has master rebalance which uses ML to change the level of vocals, drums, or bass in a stereo mix. Again, if you reinstall your PC or copy over the VST from another computer it won't work due to registry and other dependencies. This is a different algorithm/model than music rebalance 1st introduced in RX7. There is Acon Digital extract dialog, but while more efficient, it's clearly worse & not built for music. Low end focus is apparently new so you can add punch to low frequencies, would be useful for adding bass punch on DRC'd songs but IDK if it would work in practice. 9 spins off Match EQ into its own module.

Ozone Elements 8 and 9 were available for free for a limited period but they might be a bit hard to find now. They included the EQ, imager, and maximizer modules. Trash 2 was also free for a limited time.

Version 10 (2022) adds an impact module to increase or decrease Dynamics. I wonder if it will be useful on your usual DRC Masters. In the past, I've been using Voxengo Transgainer for that.

Version 11 (2023) adds a clarity module. Version 11 adds vocal balance to master assistant. It uses ML to separate and analyze the vocals to be the correct volume. this feature this also available in the elements addition.

 
### User Interface

### Controls

You might not notice this, but the lack of rotary knobs is a deliberate design decision. Instead, they have sliders and sometimes, vertical knobs. You can also type in specific values. I don't have any problems with rotary knobs (if you can adjust the value via horizontal/vertical mouse movement), unless they behave literally like a rotary knob, like, you need to move the mouse in a circle to adjust the value. From version 6 text is enlarged and controls are simplified. But I wonder if you lose some control in the process. Version 10 onwards his circular elements which behave like vertical sliders like The Orb widgets in zynaptiq plugins.

![Ozone 11 orb controls](https://claudiomeloni.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iZotope-Ozone-11.jpg)

### Colours
Version 5 makes the UI a lot bigger. Version 5 opts for a muted light green instead of fluorescent green look from the first four versions. Version 6 begins a process towards interface with blue highlights instead of green, bigger text, and simplification of the UI. Version 7's vintage modules have a light yellow background, but Version 8 changes them to black and blue - the same as other modules.

### Conclusion

Although I have mostly migrated to free plugins. Ozone over its 20-year history (starting from 2001), has incorporated current trends. While real mastering engineers (R) may prefer to use something else, it's been [credited] with making mastering more accessible, and it's there if you need it.

- Ozone 4: Low CPU use
- Ozone 5: Comprehensive legacy features
- Ozone 9+: Modern features

Although I used Ozone for mixing, izotope would rather you use alloy 2, but that has been discontinued as of 2017 in favor of neutron and nectar for vocals.

Most of the modules in Ozone I have now replaced with free or built-in alternatives which usually use less CPU, but with less control and worse sound.

## Believing in Lovely

The idea of doing the Cindy-Wonder came about since someone wanted to do a mashup of Cindy & Tommy Tallerico songs from earthworm jim. The original idea didn't work well, but I had Stevie Wonder - Isn't She Lovely in mind. Since the key change is moderate, I need to use a MIDI version. This also ensures that I can make the tempo constant.

Although I used Stevie Wonder for this mashup, there is actually a real link between Cindy and Stevie Wonder. [He produced her debut album](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3036474-Cindy-26) . 

### Converting 4/4 audio to 6/8

However, Isn't She Lovely is 12/8 time, and Cindy is 4/4 time. I initially thought of editing and removing drum beats from SL. But I left that for a few months. A few months later, the idea of stretch markers popped into my head. I also found out Reaper has an adjustable swing grid. I read some information on both, but it isn't quite as easy as that since neither built-in feature can add swing to a finished song. After some research online, I came up with a working method:

1. Download and install S&M tools for RPR. I currently use RPR 6.8, and I was surprised that you only need a minimum of 5.9 for the latest version, since I remember when I was trying to add it to Reaper 4.5 (dated 2013 ish), it was quite sensitive to version changes.
2. Set a Tempo grid of 1/8.
3. Add X-raym add stretch markers at Tempo grid divisions.
4. Install mpl quantize tool. I found the latest 3.5 version too complex, so I found a 1.8 version from the git commit history.
5. Set the source as swing grid 66%, and set the target as stretch markers. This will turn your audio into 12/8 by adding swing. Since the time-stretch ratios get moderately large it works best on vocals, not instrumentals.

You also need to set the stretch marker mode to tonal, to reduce artefacts.

### Structure

The two songs differ in arrangement, and the Cindy song is quite long. So I decided on verse verse chorus, instrumental break verse chorus. The harmonica Melody in the break was modified to include parts of Cindy's melody and a bit of Pitch Bend was added.

Each sections were taken in order from the original song. Since the structure of Cindy was changed, the lyrics might not be logical anymore.

I could have also added the lalala lalala from My Cherie Amour, but I'm not bothered, and there might be some trouble fitting it in.

I tested my mashup on some headphones, it sounded a bit bright. ReaFIR was used to compress the highs /tambs since there were multiple MIDI clips.

This mashup was submitted for a love mashathon contest. The contest aims are slightly different in that there's no voting phase, and difficulty of execution as a judging criteria. so that means more than a simple A vs B mashup. Converting 4/4 audio to 6/8, and use of MIDI are factors, but that might pale in comparison to people then used many different songs.

As with MIDI in reaper 6 the output is not deterministic - you sometimes have stuck notes, so you need to render a few times, then subtract the outputs to compare differences and hope for the best.

After rendering, I noticed a difference - a bass instrument paned slightly left. I made a new project with all basses centered, but after consideration that the claivnet was panned right, it would balance the bass guitar panned left, so I left it as is.

## Style-Last Christmas
This mashup was originally submitted to the Christmas 2022 mashup contest. It was a great concept, but There were some tuning issues on Last Christmas. The Judge remade it with a different instrumental for the album. The original concept was remade and included as a bonus track on the Christmas album, but I didn't like it since it had last Christmas vocals and the vox was pitched down to match the non-regular tuning of Last Christmas. I sought permission from Philip 16 mashups to remake it and they agreed.

The sources I got were HQ with ML already done so all I need to do is the mashup arrangement and mixing. Incredibly, except for extending the introduction,  the structure of Last Christmas pretty much matches Taylor Swift Style.

The aim of my mashup is to fix the tuning issues, and also have better mixing by turning down the synth Bell. The latter was done with a combination of ReaFIR and EQ mid cut. The vocals were moderately compressed so that they can be heard during the verses, as Last Christmas has a almost constant dynamic. 

Revisiting this in November 2023 and applying loudness meters to both tracks, I find out that the vocals are too loud. So I redo the gain structure for the project, and reduce the vocals

Listening to the mashup on earbuds, it sounds like the instrumental and vocals are in different spaces. This is due to the instrumental being too narrow, and modern vocals being wide at times. So I applied some stereo widening to the instrumental and stereo reduction to the vocals. But now the synth bell is too wide. Now this is actually a 3 band stereo imaging scenario, and none of the built-in plugins can do this with one effect, so I need to use ozone 4 for this. When the stereo was expanded, I noticed at the start of the song, the synth was unbalanced to one side on both earbuds and speakers, so I reduced the effect. 

The bass was slightly low and I was wondering if I could add some modern bass levels to the song, so I used my multi-band distortion trick to add a bit of bass. I later used a EQ bass boost instead since it would be distorted/compressed again by album mastering.

The vocals sounded a bit cramped so I reduce the compression settings so that it's not compressing as hard.

The feedback from the original author was that the vocals came too early. I got the original of the vocal song before vox extraction, and used that as a guide to have the vox at the right times. The feedback from the judge was that the pre-chorus vox was too quiet, so I boosted it a bit.

There were also some low-level tones at the start & end of the song. I had to gain the master by 30DB to hear it. It's not a master bus issue. It's a track issue, and It's caused by using analog / hybrid crossover in izotope ozone 4 (on digital silence). Using digital crossover fixed it, but uses slightly more CPU. It's not fixed in version 4.04, nor 5.04. This issue potentially effects every project that I used ozone 4 on.
