# Music Mashups Mixing Notes

## Never Give Up on the Good Times-Nexus

So, I had the idea for NGU-Nexus when I was listening to a cover of NGU, and noticed the chords sounded like 4536, It would go well with Osanpo biyori instro, except I had already used it with Nexus aca. So I need to use it with the Nexus instro. I tried shuffling the chords in Nexus, originally 3456 to 4536. But the original 3456 sounded more natural due to piano & etc fill. I originally had the proj @ 120bpm since the vox was at 117. But due to stretching & a pitch shift of the vox at the end of +2st, and the fast speed of the original instro, it would sound bad, so I raised it to 128. I thought about using Mai Kotone's Renai Circulation House cover, and the speed matches a bit better, but the minimal instrumentation and spectrum conflicted with NGU, so I reverted back to Nexus. I set the bpm to 124 and made the vox go only up by 1st at the end to reduce speed issues.  Elastique VST2 now works, but I'm hesitant to use it in a project .
This is also the 1st project that has FFTMT sustain control used from the start, but FFTMT Noise/GF works better.
There was an instro available of NGU sometime, but the instro differs at the end so I need to use ML-derived vox. DUring the bridge, ML results aren't great  so I need to chop & replace looped lyrics to sound OK.
