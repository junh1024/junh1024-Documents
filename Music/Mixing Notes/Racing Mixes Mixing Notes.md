# Racing Mixes Mixing Notes



## Racing Mixes
Originally I thought to have separate TDU & NFS series for a brief while, but decided to combine them. I opened separate projects for TDU & NFS importing. I did combined imports for each series, split them off into their own projects, then moved songs between each as necessary. As Charlie https://blog.chiariglione.org/a-future-without-mpeg/ quoted from the 3 kingdoms, " things divided for a long time shall unite, things united for a long time shall divide", only this was a much shorter period. As with the Touhou series, I had a problem of running 2 different styles of mixes in the same series, I opted for the same odd-even approach. Odd number = slow/rock songs, Even = fast/electronic songs. So I re-numbered the TDU & NFS mixes.

### Concept

The idea for my Gran Turismo mix came about since I was trying to do my Anime House Mix and insert some Gran Turismo songs, but they didn't really fit due to unique sound and short length. In 2022, someone shared some menu music from Gran Turismo 5 (incl Like A Bird), so I decided to start Gran Turismo mix project with those Gran Turismo songs into this mix project.

In September 2024, a new r-trance contest was announced. The theme was short mixes with a limit of exactly 20 minutes. So my unfinished projects of 25-45 mins wouldn't qualify, and editing down, also wouldn't be nice. I eventually found my Gran Turismo mix (of menu themes) which was about 11 minutes, added the piano song, and did some tweaks like EQ & imaging.


### What's in a description?

The secret identification question is "Describe Your Mix in 5 Words or Less" . I considered using the Gran Turismo subtitle which is "The Real Driving Simulator". There's also other tag lines for GT5 like "The Drive Of Your Life". But those might be too obvious. I was browsing the Wikipedia pages for GT4 and GT5, and I saw on the front of the box art for GT5 it had a "Only On PlayStation" badge. So that's the description of my mix. But many people didn't get the hint.

### Received Feedback

Many people liked the Jazzy House music and mixing, but opinions were mixed on the concept. Not many people commented on the starting piano track surprisingly, and it wasn't much of a stunt compared to PMMME's transformative hard mix.

### Song choice

Revisiting this in 2024 for the contest, it needed to be lengthened a bit. I could also use the moon over the castle from GT4 which would be an epic opening, but it's too obvious and too long.

I remembered the GT5 Japanese opening used a piano song so I could do the same for my mix. Having a classical piano track open my entry in a trance contest is a very bold move and it might turn off some people, but it'd definitely make an impact. Mixes that stand out in genre would be more memorable to voters. A992's ambient mix [won the Halloween 2023 contest](https://old.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/184h7p3/winner_october_2023_mix_competition_pumpkin_spice/) so something to keep in mind. If there were a time to do it, now would be the time to do it for a any-genre & aesthetic contest, and I just missed the Anything Goes August 2023 contest. And I may have some regerts if I didn't try it to see how people would react. Worried it might be annoying but During play testing it was ok. It would be the 1st person to use a classical song in a trance contest.

If people say it's disconnected from the rest of the mix, it's actually still Gran Turismo. You could also say it aims roughly to deliver the experience of opening Gran Turismo. I was a bit worried 12 minutes wouldn't be long enough, but I had a look at the examples in the contest introduction and they were about 10 minutes, so 12 minutes now feels okay. But upon glancing at the submissions, it seems most people tried to use 20 minutes to the max and the avg length was about 18.5 mins. Listening back, most people also opted for megamix approach of 2 mins per song.

Themes from GT4 onwards were used. Light Velocity II & From The East To The West to were the only tracks which sounded good & fit from GT4. Then you have Like A Bird from GT5. Then it goes to Bullet-Time Bounce. I really wanted to use that song in a mix and it was like "I've finished the main program, now it's time to party". That was what I did in 2022.

I had a scrub in 2022 of the GT5 soundtrack and I expected myself to add some of those tracks to the mix. In 2024 I analyzed the BPM and Keys of the GT5 soundtrack. A lot of the songs were under 100 BPM, so wouldn't sound great when stretched. The few that were in the right range, but didn't sound great due to key or chord clashes, boring arrangement and composition due to lack of development, and a slightly different aesthetic. So I just left my mix tracklist as is.


### About songs
- Piano Sonata 7 mvt 3: This is a technically challenging piece https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._7_(Prokofiev)#III._Precipitato so it's a popular choice for piano competitions. Lang Lang is seemingly a bit hesitant in the final section.
- GT4 selections: Despite not owning Gran Turismo, it's a major racing game franchise & I've played it a few times at stores, and I may have looked up the soundtrack myself. These melodies are from GT3 but the production has been revised and polished, and the intent is now a lot clearer instead of a jam track. The drums aren't strong enough for a typical House song and it's got Jazz chords. The combination of pads, string synths, and electric piano make it distinctly Gran Turismo.
- GT5: see previous section
- Bullet-Time Bounce: I found on Volumetrique's [Summer 2022 Doujin House Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShdZwh5HAKg) . The song is in the complextro genre. Which is a [subgenre](https://edm.fandom.com/wiki/Complextro) of electrohouse. As its name implies, complextro makes electrohouse more complex. In this song, many decorations and sound effects overlay or interrupt the music. Polyphony sometimes occurs. Despite having big room elements, it still remains melodic and it's very tolerable & danceable. This song proves that there is still good music being made in 2021.

### Mixing


The phasing of the pads and the outro of Like A Bird was shifted to match the intro of BTB. 

### Editing

Piano Sonata 7 mvt 3: The original is 3 minutes, but Light Velocity II is only 2 minutes, and I don't want the intro to be longer than the main songs, so I edit it down starting from the repeat of the First motif. The first motif was replaced with the initial version to make the start more seamless, but the volume turned down to match the volume of the repeat version. It's now down to 1 minute so that's good.

On reaching the BTB, I edited in a "let's go" clip into the intro to make it more interesting, but the transition of BTB was shortened so that pads of Like A Bird segue into the introduction of BTB, so that edit wasn't used. I wanted to shorten BTB so it doesn't overshadow the other song, so at XXX I cut out about 10 seconds, and that's probably about as much as I can cut it w/o noticeably affecting the other parts of the song.


Listening back to my mix BTB sounded a bit boring so I had to put in my edit of BTB. 

I also had an idea of putting Blue Topaz Remix from Ridge Racer into my mix. This would bring the mix length to 16 minutes and would be a satisfying length. It would also fit in well with the PlayStation and Jazzy House theme. I considered using my Blue Topaz-Dance The Night mashup, but it might have more variety if I use the original. I thought it would transition well in between Like A Bird and BTB if I use the tribal drums with BV section. I spent some time on the transitions, but it didn't work out too well. So I had to take it out and revert to an older version of my project.

The transition to BTB is still a bit abrupt. Original phasing gave chord clashes. So I have high pass to get the cymbals from the original phrase to make it sound smoother, and then the low pass on the shifted phrase to make a sound in chord.

On like a bird , the hi-hats were too strong so I used ReaFIR to turn them down.

If the stereo image is too wide in a certain frequency range, there are two major approaches. One. Use a multi-band stereo imager or two. Use multi-band mid-side EQ. Using a multi-band stereo imager is simpler, but the choice of frequency & implementation is important if you're trying to fix a specific problem since you need to compensate for the width of the crossover. A mid-side EQ would give you more certainty and control over the frequency, but is more complex.

I've been trying to find a free mid-side EQ for Reaper for a while. I've been using isotope ozone 4 for a while and it does the job, but I eventually found toneboosters EQ which is free. You need to go over to support Legacy downloads tone boosters portable insert path here. While tone boosters EQ is free and uses less CPU then ozone 4 comma it's less intuitive. in the end, I settled on the built-in stereo enhancer to narrow the high frequencies. 

From the east to the west is mostly narrow but it has the annoying shaker at the side. in the end when put into the mix it still sounds a bit bad so I'll need to leave it like this.
