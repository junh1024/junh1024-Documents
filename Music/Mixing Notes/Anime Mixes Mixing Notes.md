# Anime Mixes Mixing Notes

## Introduction
Apart from the instrumental house & trance songs, most of the pop-ish songs weren't meant to be joined as they lack large lead sections and an decent range of intensity. Also, the Japanese love their complexity so have tricky chord progressions & key changes. But key changes opens up more possibilities for joins, at the expense of maybe needing to join mid-song. Most of these are available on my [junh1024 YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGqlhiQ9Eu-zsIdK_NRecdQ)


## Orchestral 2
So AC4 Blockade & Megalith are in the same key, but vastly different BPM so they sound awkward when joined. I was going over the RE-RESIST album recently & I noticed that Invitation to the nihility was in a similar style/BPM/key as Blockade. I tried joining them together & they fit OK (with a house-style overlapping join). 1 thing to care about is EQ during the transition, and EQ across the tracks. ITTN needs a high cut, to match Megalith. Megalith needs a bass & drum boost to match ITTN. I think Megalith also had live recorded elements as there's uneven tempo across the song, like both clips need stretching to match the BPM of the Megalith intro. I also wanted to extend the mix with more songs. I started looking at the Classics boxset from Hybrid, since they do a similar orchestral-electronic style. I know Dreaming Your Dreams, it's good, but it's too fast. There's In Good We Trust which is a similar BPM, but it's slightly lacking drums, rather short, & it feels a bit too dark. If you know any songs in a similar style, key (D or Dm), & BPM (75 +- 10%), lemme know & I might extend it

## Anime Trance 2
I had a few EXIT TRANCE songs since I collect remixes of anime (themes) I watch. I also wondered whether I could make a trance version of my rock mix. C3 & light prayer is there, and I expected some yanaginagi songs in trance, but there aren't any. There's also not many Bakemon themes after OP3 in trance. There's some pokemon trance, but not kaze no message. So I did a bunch of joins,

magic number>battle frontier would be reserved for Trance4. I had been wanting to use magic number for a while, I tried to use it in the past as rear material for my surround upscale of the original version, but removed it in the end.

After being semi-familiar with C3, I'm expecting a bit of piano decorations in the verse of C3, but there aren't any in the trance version, so I add some MIDI from tosa's MIDI. But not too much as to muddy the mix. Mainly high notes. They did have some piano in the bridge, but it's not very loud so the MIDI reinforces it.

light prayer > rock over japan is a bum transition so that I can stick in the rock over japan > tomare join, which is good. There is a perfect area complete, and it's in D# too (which I also used in the end of my rock mix), so I can join that to tomare. There is a secret base also in D#, and that does have an ending, so I join that, and end the mix. It takes a while to end, so I cut it short to give it greater impact.

For the beginning, I used to have MPD OP2 (shonen), it's an OK join, but it's not much of a proper start. I tried joining it with the original version in my head, and it didn't sound good in my head, nor realized. But I know that joining the original start with the trance C3 would sound good, and I was mostly right, so I start with that.

Actually, many of of the songs have breakbeat sections in them.

This project was started in the past, so light prayer was stretched by 10% with elastique 2, which makes it sound mushy & quiet. Thus, the volume was boosted 1dB to compensate. Revisiting this project in 2025,  I had upgraded RPR so the much better elastique 3 is available. Looking at the loudness graph after render, I noticed that light prayer is louder, so I need to undo the volume boost since elastique 3 is much better at preserving drums at high stretch ratios.

Secret base was replaced with can you remember love, since secret base their production wasn't that great with notes and unison and cheesy production.



## Anime Trance 4
Nothing wrong with the song selection (I select songs I know/like). The problem with EXIT TRANCE CDs is that they're pre-mixed, slight lack of medium/low energy sections & already done transition sections, and a fast transition style, so the only thing I can do is match that. So to cut it shorter, do another fast transition, & hope it works. It works about half the time. I could make 1-2 more mixes, but I'm limited since a lack of songs with endings since it's pre-mixed, most song don't have endings.

By the time I finished the initial draft, it was around 27", decent length. So I can slow the BPM from 180 to 170 to extend it. It seemed a bit slow @ 1st, but I got used to it. I scrubbed through the mix quickly, but then I found out some songs had annoying trance synth solos in them, so I did a more careful scrub, and cut those out. The level of perceived high frequencies between songs varied, so I had different tracks to boost, or cut them via EQ. Hare Yukai was only 1 of the songs that sounded like it had an ending near the end so I ended on that, and applied some reverb to slightly extend the ending.



## MSLN-rewrite 
I've been working on my MSLN-rewrite (extended) mix on & off since mid-2019, and it still isn't finished. I had groups of 2-3 songs joined, but nothing long enough for a finished mix. In late 2020, I decided to sort my Traktor song collection by BPM, and found a few songs to add. Then there seemed to be 2 groups of songs with compatible keys, so after some editing, I spun them off into their separate mixes. Since HNP is in F#, songs so join with it seem to be hard to find since songs in # keys are a bit rarer. Also, HNP ends with strings so I need to find a song with a similar kind of wideband energy. I tried koibumi (with toki no kakera afterwards) , didn't go well. "Niji ga umareta hi" joined well, but I don't like the opera-style vox.

## Orchestral 3
I had already used orchestral ID 1 & 2 starting from end of 2019, mid 2020. So I need to continue from 3 even though this group of mixes is older. Like my Touhou convention, odd IDs = slow, even = fast. I guessed which songs would join well together & went from there. There is some MIDI going from "secret of my heart" to "Shadow & light". Overall, this mix sounds OK. Now that the stereo mix is done, it's time to upscale the songs to surround, using V+I & spleeter.

## Orchestral 5
I've been a bit indecisive about putting "Mishiranu Kuni no Tripper" in a mix. Since it's got a very distinctive retro sound (before that rubbish vaporwave trend). Due to the ritard at the end of "Mamoru beki mono", going to "tengoku no kioku" sounds a bit bad. By chance, most of the songs in this mix have a surround ver, but TNK is quite bad, might as well upscale it to surround from spleeter. 
This mix is a bit worse than O3.

## Fast Pop 2 
In January 2021 I revised this mix. I tweaked the V/I balance of MPD OP2. Due to 2011 Sky song sounding bad at the end, I restored "Kimi no shiranai Monogatari". But since the quiet section would be before the middle, I have to add on a song at the start to balance it. I got "Advance Adventure" from my Fast Pop 1 project. I tested a few inpoints for "Platina", and at the beginning sounds best (as instro) + the vox from AA. Now that the mix is balanced, it's now >30m, so I need to cut it. I'm noticing KNSM is quite long so I cut it. The inpoint is now something like V2. V2 is the most familiar verse since the anime ED starts that way. It is now 28m now. Coincidentally, it now ends on the sane key as it starts with 2001 Sky at the end.

## Fast Pop 1
I started this mix in late 2019 after finishing my rock mix. "Dramatic Carpet Ride" & "Yukitoki" are both around 165bpm & would suit the beginning of a mix. So I did. DCR sounds a bit better slowed down anyway. There's a break after the intro of Yukitoki so that's the transition for DCR > Yukitoki. Yukitoki has a xfade in the middle to eliminate partial bars to make the mix easier to manage so that the bar ruler is almost always right. I originally had "Advance Adventure" after Yukitoki. I needed to pitch AA down so that the key fits, but it was a bit awkward. In 2021 it is substituted with Kazeyomi Ribbon. AA, like luminous, was exported in 71 for more flexibility/control over A/I in surround.

I sorted songs in Traktor and found a bunch of songs. "Lonely rolling star" is in the same key as "Kaze no message", but since it's in ambisonics (regerts), it has a different "sound" than the rest of the songs. 

"Bright stream" was a song that got kicked out from my Rock mix due to being too busy-sounding when sped-up (someone noticed), so it is in this lower 165b mix. It joins well with "Authentic symphony", another song that was kicked out (maybe from FP2 or rock). Going from BS to AUS, I tested a few different places to join ranging from V1, V2, etc. In the end, I settled on the chorus since it maintains a similar energy/sound at the transition point. Then cuts to V1. AUS joins well with "Magic number", minimal editing there. "Starlog" is also a similar tempo, but it's in a different key' But it has transition & sections which change key. So putting those there would be distraction enough to sound smooth. I originally had a transition section of pre-chorus1 (which I'm used to) then C1, but I could also use pre-V2 then V2 which sounds better. Or I could also go PC1 then V2 (which sounds awkward). "Starlog" has this section in a different key after C2 with lyrics. It sounds quite out of place so I removed it.
