# How to use Baidu Pan

1. Register a Baidu account https://passport.baidu.com/v2/?reg (some mobiles may not work, if it doesn't there are methods using [duspeaker](https://www.gizdev.com/create-baidu-account-without-china-number-and-vpn/) )
2. Login (China loves their 2FA), open your Pan link, check the folders/files, and add to your drive (white []--> button with box & right arrow)
3. Install the official client http://pan.baidu.com/download (unofficial & the webGUI clients tend to not transfer/work)
4. Browse to your drive, and get your files
5. Optional: run the client in a VM or sandboxed cuz it adds an annoying icon to "My Computer"
6. Suggested: disable the appearance options & add BaiduNetdisk.exe & BaiduNetdiskHost.exe to Sandboxie's Resource:COM exceptions to reduce CPU
7. Optional: Rename your folders for easy identification. Rename has a Âêç in it. Do this before you transfer.
8. Optional: expand your space to 1T by [using the mobile app](https://techjourney.net/get-2tb-free-cloud-storage-space-on-baidu-yun-drive-baidu-pan-web-disk/) . Works as of 2019.
