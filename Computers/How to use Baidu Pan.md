# How to use Baidu Pan

1. Register a Baidu account https://passport.baidu.com/v2/?reg . If it doesn't work, there are methods using [Baidu Cloud](https://www.infinityfolder.com/how-to-create-a-baidu-account-from-outside-china/) or [duspeaker](https://www.gizdev.com/create-baidu-account-without-china-number-and-vpn/) 
2. Install the official client http://pan.baidu.com/download (unofficial & the webGUI clients tend to not transfer/work)
3. Login (China loves their 2FA), and open your Pan link
4. Check the files you want, and click and add to your drive (white []--> button with box & right arrow)
5. Browse to your drive in the client (1st tab), and click DL to get your files (downwards arrow icon)
6. Tip: To remove the BP drive icon from My Computer, click settings <o> in the toolbar, settings <o> item, and uncheck the 1st item. OK.
7. Tip: Rename your folders for easy identification. Rename has a Âêç in it.
8. Tip: expand your space to 1T by [using the mobile app](https://techjourney.net/get-2tb-free-cloud-storage-space-on-baidu-yun-drive-baidu-pan-web-disk/) . Works as of 2019.
