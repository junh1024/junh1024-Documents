# Explaining the news stories seen by the Hoshino family

Introduction
---
In Katamari Damacy, as you complete the story mode, you are rewarded with FMVs showing daily life of the Hoshino family. The father is an astronaut, while the son watches the news. There are some rather strange happenings. I will try to explain some similar scenarios.

The stars have disappeared from the sky, and this is expected
---
So, it might be daytime, or there is a lot of light pollution. In the countryside where there's less lighting at night, you can see more stars.

The stars have disappeared from the sky, and this is unexpected
---
Maybe there's a giant dust cloud over Japan, don't ask me how this happened. The stars have traditionally been important for their cultural significance, but also for navigation.

The moon has disappeared from the sky
---
So, a [lunar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse) happens 1ce a month when the earth is in front of the moon, the moon appears dimmer. To make it disappear, you could have a [volcano throw some dust into the air](https://youtu.be/VW2xRR75lKE?t=90) . 

The moon has de-orbited from the earth
---
You really don't want this to happen. As shown by the pockmarks on the moon, it's taken a few hits so Earth doesn't have to. Like Jupiter in 1994 with comet [Shoemaker-levy-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9) . With the moon gone, this will affect some power generation, and biological cycles.

How might this happen? I can't think of any short-term interactions between celestial bodies that might cause this. But Some recent observations have suggested that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and hence might end in a big rip, when the force of gravity gets overwhelmed. A few minuites before the big rip, the planets & moons in out solar system (assuming it still exists), will sort of fly out into space.

Conclusion
---
The above 4 scenarios are mostly associated with bad events IRL. You probably don't want them to happen, but some of them are inevitable without human input. But anyway,

- Protect the earth
- Protect education
- Protect science funding & a clear view of the night sky so scientists can look for killer asteroids, although Elon Musk's brightly-painted starlink satellites aren't a great help
