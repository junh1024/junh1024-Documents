# Why nature would evolve something like Mimosa pudica (commentary)

Introduction
---
There's been a few posts of MP pics & I recently got one. Its distinctive trait is retracting its leaflets in response to stimuli, and is achieved by moving water around the plant. Apart from other fascinating reading like https://www.google.com/search?q=trees+can+talk  , why would nature make a plant that can move, since it's not eating anything like nutritionous flies (venus flytrap), and it takes much energy to do so? Whether it moves or not the prickles & fir are still there. Luckily, wiki has some answers so I'll provide my take on it.

Reasons
---
**[MP moves since] Animals may be afraid of a fast moving plant and would rather eat a less active one**. Things like stick insects & primantises exist, so a static plant might be safer to eat.
**[MP moves to] shade the plant in order to reduce water lossage due to evaporation** 
**[MP is] primarily found on soils with low nutrient concentrations**. So maybe it's found its own niche growing in poor soils with low competition. It makes friends with  nitrogen-fixing bacteria (this is how it gets most of its nitrogen), and wards off many others with chemical warfare.

It can also extract certain pollutants from the soil, but so can other things https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectomycorrhiza#Heavy_metals  (which is why certain mushrooms are toxic to humans)

If you like meta theories, you could say nature made it to perplex humans, or you could maybe put a certain philosophical spin on it like "to see how jazzed up it can get" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYHp8LwBUzo (Everything game trailer)

TLDR: (I do something unique/important) plz NOBULLY.
